    Q. Bubble chart stack
    ...
    Here's what I envision:
        3 columns, spread evenly across the width of the screen.
        3 data lists: projects, employees, and technologies
        At first, we send an API request for each column, simply getting all available entries.
        When user selects one project, the other 2 columns send an API request with a query limiting results to pertain to only that project.
        Each column upates individually, based on the global variable of what (project, employee, tech) is selected (or if nothing is selected).
    This can be accomplished in any server language, client language, storage system, or rendering tools.
    Storage system can be anything, as this is so vague that any database will accomplish the job. MySQL comes to mind because it's relational, and very fast at that.
    ...
    A. I personally like NodeJS and ReactJS, just because they work so well with data and microservices. 
        D3 is good at rendering any kind of charts or visualizations, and works well with React. So, I would probably pick that. Although so far the requirement is so simple, based on my vision of 3 columns filled with bubbles, that we could probably render a pretty good column of bubbles with ReactJS without any visualization library at all.
        If we consider the local-storage of this data, on the client, then React will definitely do a great job. Each column can be its own component, with its own list of data, handle its own API requests, and display its own chart - all without duplicating code - because it will tap into a common codebase for the REST API calls and Bubble-rendering components.

    Q. Hospital application stack
    ...
    Again, this requirement is so vague that really anything will accomplish the job.
    But, this is billing and insurance information - serious stuff! So we must ensure top security.
    Unfortunately, I have not dealt a lot with security concerns, especially back-end. Most I've done is one-way hashed passwords before sending them or storing them.
    ...
    A. Honestly, I would suggest to ask someone that is more experienced than myself on the matter. This is what I would do - read a lot, and if possible - ask people more experienced with security.
        I would pick NodeJS + ReactJS (+ Redux) just because I am most comfortable with this. I have more experience in PHP + AngularJS, but have a much better feeling that I didn't forget to configure or escape something when working with Node and React.
