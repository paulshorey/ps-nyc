        Learning AngularJS, wanted to see what I can do, came up with an "angular" design for a custom content management system. Triangle shapes pointing from the top menu (dark blue), to the content menu (blue), to the content form (light blue). Great practice fitting a lot of functinality into a simple app. Try it at: <a href="http://angularcms.net" target="_blank">http://angularcms.net &raquo;</a>

        Served as lead developer at this enterprise movie news site, until they closed the NYC office. Many people relied on it for movie and industry news. It later evolved to be more strictly mini-sites and marketing sites for individual feature films. I've made sites and apps for films like Moonrise Kingdom, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Coraline, and Boxtrolls. <a href="http://focusfeatures.com" target="_blank">FocusFeatures.com &raquo;</a>

        Google TV was supposed to be the next big thing: a smart TV that searched content from all over the web, and had channels like Roku and Samsung do. I developed a prototype for a Tv channel. It runs in a modified the Chrome browser, as most other Google inventions. But the user would only have the arrow keys, "enter" and "esc" to navigate it. <a href="http://focusfeatures.com/tv">FocusFeatures.com/TV &raquo;</a>

        Before Wordpress re-designed their UI in 2009, it was difficult to use, though not as difficult as Joomla/Droopal/Typo3. Back then it was an tedious work for independent website owners to manage their site using a full featured CMS. I designed and developed this "easy" CMS for my clients. Made with PHP/MySQL on the backend and jQuery UI on the front. It is built into the site itself. It uses custom html tags that lay dormant until the user signs in. Since then, most of my clients migrated to SquareSpace and Shoppify. But, the CMS and demo site are still running.

        Adding here mainly for my own nostalgia, but these have been made in 2008/2009, on a custom PHP CMS platform. Some are still in use and functional, just like the custom CMS that runs them (above). <a href="http://jewelrybytracie.com/galleries/index.php?category=nature%20series&item=414" target="_blank">JewelryByTracie.com &raquo;</a>  &nbsp;<a href="http://HandMadeByLaura.com" target="_blank">HandMadeByLaura.com &raquo;</a>  &nbsp;<a href="http://PurpleLanternStudio.com" target="_blank">PurpleLanternStudio.com &raquo;</a>
