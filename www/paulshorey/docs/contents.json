      "content": "### CSS is not hard. Just review the properties at the bottom of this page.  \n  \n### And know these gotchas/oddities:  \n#### Aligning vs. Centering  \n* To **\"vertically-align\"** something, we mean to align some text or image, or icon relative to its siblings. To make text or a link look good next to a button or icon. To accomplish this, simply put **`vertical-align:middle`** on every **SIBLING**. The container doesn't matter.  \n* To **\"vertically-center\"** something is to actually place a small element visibly in the middle of a larger element. You may think to off-set the child from the top with `padding` or `margin-top` or just `top`, but that would require you to know the exact height of the parent and child, and any other contents which could shove the child out of center. Instead, use  **`display:flex;align-items:center`** on the **PARENT**, and the web browser will take care of the sizing.  \n* To **\"horizontally align\"** or **\"horizontally center\"** something is usually the same thing, but is done differently for \"inline\" vs \"block\" level elements.  \n    * To center some text or an image in a line, you would add **`text-align:center`** to its **PARENT**.  \n    * To center some block (like a div) on the page, add **`margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;`** on **ITSELF**, the **CHILD**. For this block centering to work, the child must have some width, and the parent must also be a block element, with a greater width.  \n#### Negative Margin-Top vs. Negative Top  \n* **`margin-left: -10px`** or **`margin-top: -10px`** is totally allowed, and can make your UI pixel perfect by nudging your element slightly to the side. But **BEWARE**. It is a hack. It will shift the element you're nudging in unpredictable ways, and thus shift all its children and parents. **INSTEAD**, you may use **`position:relative; top:-10px`** to accomplish the same thing. This will nudge the element just as well, but will not affect any other elements. To the sibling and parent elements, it will be as if the child was never nudged at all.  \n#### Box-Sizing, and Width Surprises  \n* You make a button of **`width:100px`**. It fits nicely into your UI. But then you add a **`padding: 20px`**, and it no longer fits. In fact, it looks now more like **`140px`**. **Why?** The padding was added to the element's width. If you now add a border of **`2px`**, now the total width grows again to **`144px`**. This is because your container element has property **`box-sizing: content-box;`**. To make the **padding** and **border** widths fit **INSIDE** the specified element width (and height), change the parent (or entire page) to use **`box-sizing: border-box;`**.  \n  \n##  \n# Basic Properties:  \n* position:  \n    * **static** ~ default value, makes element think it has NO position property.  \n    * **relative** ~ relative to its surroundings. Lets you to add **top, left, bottom, right**, to shift it a bit to any direction  \n    * **fixed** ~ relative to the window - use **top, left, bottom, right** to position the element any number of units from the top/left/bottom/right of the screen boundaries.  \n    * **absolute** ~ same as fixed, but relative to the parent element (well, the closest parent which has a specified positon property)  \n* display:  \n    * **block** ~ wrap to their own line, and take up 100% available width! Used to layout visual blocks on the page, with height, padding, border, etc. (**div, blockquote, header, article, main** have this by default)  \n    * **inline** ~ for text elements which do not have height or width or margin or vertical padding (**span, b, i, u, img, code** have this by default)  \n    * **inline-block** ~ best of both worlds. Can have vertical height and padding, but do not wrap to their own line! So, can style a padded button or highlight in the middle of a paragraph.  \n    * **flex** ~ read about it. It will change your life. **Note:** it affects the children, not itself! Simple example: Lets you have a fixed-width left column, and a main article section which takes up the remaining page width, no matter how wide or narrow the screen is.  \n    * **inline-flex** ~ flex content inline! Like a pill-button, with left/right sections.  \n    * **grid** ~ new hotness. Not like \"masonry\", but still very useful.  \n* margin:  \n    * **0 0 0 10px** add 10px margin outside of the element to the left  \n    * **0 10px** add 10px margin to left and right. Zero to top/bottom  \n    * **10px** add to all sides  \n    * **10px 0 0 0** same as margin-top:10px  \n    * Margin adds space **outside** of the element's boundaries. So, **outside** of the element's width/height, padding, border, background.  \n* padding:  \n    * like margin, but adds space **inside** the element's boundarids. So, **inside** the border. Increases width/height, and is covered by background.  \n* float:  \n    * never copy from some answer on some website.

Just review the properties at the bottom of this page.</h3>\n<h3>And know these gotchas/oddities:</h3>\n<h4>Aligning vs. Centering</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To <strong>“vertically-align”</strong> something, we mean to align some text or image, or icon relative to its siblings. To make text or a link look good next to a button or icon. To accomplish this, simply put <strong><code>vertical-align:middle</code></strong> on every <strong>SIBLING</strong>. The container doesn’t matter.</li>\n<li>To <strong>“vertically-center”</strong> something is to actually place a small element visibly in the middle of a larger element. You may think to off-set the child from the top with <code>padding</code> or <code>margin-top</code> or just <code>top</code>, but that would require you to know the exact height of the parent and child, and any other contents which could shove the child out of center. Instead, use  <strong><code>display:flex;align-items:center</code></strong> on the <strong>PARENT</strong>, and the web browser will take care of the sizing.</li>\n<li>To <strong>“horizontally align”</strong> or <strong>“horizontally center”</strong> something is usually the same thing, but is done differently for “inline” vs “block” level elements.\n<ul>\n<li>To center some text or an image in a line, you would add <strong><code>text-align:center</code></strong> to its <strong>PARENT</strong>.</li>\n<li>To center some block (like a div) on the page, add <strong><code>margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;</code></strong> on <strong>ITSELF</strong>, the <strong>CHILD</strong>. For this block centering to work, the child must have some width, and the parent must also be a block element, with a greater width.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Negative Margin-Top vs. Negative Top</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>margin-left: -10px</code></strong> or <strong><code>margin-top: -10px</code></strong> is totally allowed, and can make your UI pixel perfect by nudging your element slightly to the side. But <strong>BEWARE</strong>. It is a hack. It will shift the element you’re nudging in unpredictable ways, and thus shift all its children and parents. <strong>INSTEAD</strong>, you may use <strong><code>position:relative; top:-10px</code></strong> to accomplish the same thing. This will nudge the element just as well, but will not affect any other elements. To the sibling and parent elements, it will be as if the child was never nudged at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Box-Sizing, and Width Surprises</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You make a button of <strong><code>width:100px</code></strong>. It fits nicely into your UI. But then you add a <strong><code>padding: 20px</code></strong>, and it no longer fits. In fact, it looks now more like <strong><code>140px</code></strong>. <strong>Why?</strong> The padding was added to the element’s width. If you now add a border of <strong><code>2px</code></strong>, now the total width grows again to <strong><code>144px</code></strong>. This is because your container element has property <strong><code>box-sizing: content-box;</code></strong>. To make the <strong>padding</strong> and <strong>border</strong> widths fit <strong>INSIDE</strong> the specified element width (and height), change the parent (or entire page) to use <strong><code>box-sizing: border-box;</code></strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<h1>Basic Properties:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>position:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>static</strong> ~ default value, makes element think it has NO position property.</li>\n<li><strong>relative</strong> ~ relative to its surroundings. Lets you to add <strong>top, left, bottom, right</strong>, to shift it a bit to any direction</li>\n<li><strong>fixed</strong> ~ relative to the window - use <strong>top, left, bottom, right</strong> to position the element any number of units from the top/left/bottom/right of the screen boundaries.</li>\n<li><strong>absolute</strong> ~ same as fixed, but relative to the parent element (well, the closest parent which has a specified positon property)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>display:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>block</strong> ~ wrap to their own line, and take up 100% available width! Used to layout visual blocks on the page, with height, padding, border, etc. (<strong>div, blockquote, header, article, main</strong> have this by default)</li>\n<li><strong>inline</strong> ~ for text elements which do not have height or width or margin or vertical padding (<strong>span, b, i, u, img, code</strong> have this by default)</li>\n<li><strong>inline-block</strong> ~ best of both worlds. Can have vertical height and padding, but do not wrap to their own line! So, can style a padded button or highlight in the middle of a paragraph.</li>\n<li><strong>flex</strong> ~ read about it. It will change your life. <strong>Note:</strong> it affects the children, not itself! Simple example: Lets you have a fixed-width left column, and a main article section which takes up the remaining page width, no matter how wide or narrow the screen is.</li>\n<li><strong>inline-flex</strong> ~ flex content inline! Like a pill-button, with left/right sections.</li>\n<li><strong>grid</strong> ~ new hotness. Not like “masonry”, but still very useful.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>margin:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>0 0 0 10px</strong> add 10px margin outside of the element to the left</li>\n<li><strong>0 10px</strong> add 10px margin to left and right. Zero to top/bottom</li>\n<li><strong>10px</strong> add to all sides</li>\n<li><strong>10px 0 0 0</strong> same as margin-top:10px</li>\n<li>Margin adds space <strong>outside</strong> of the element’s boundaries. So, <strong>outside</strong> of the element’s width/height, padding, border, background.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>padding:\n<ul>\n<li>like margin, but adds space <strong>inside</strong> the element’s boundarids. So, <strong>inside</strong> the border. Increases width/height, and is covered by background.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>float:\n<ul>\n<li>never copy from some answer on some website. Only use if you know its gotchas and glitches</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>top, left, right, bottom:\n<ul>\n<li>move the element some distance in any direction, used with the <code>position</code> prop</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>text-align\n<ul>\n<li>horizontal-align <strong>text</strong> or images, or any <strong><code>display:inline</code></strong>  or <strong><code>display:inline-block</code></strong> element - <strong>left/center/right</strong></li>\n<li>put this on the <strong>parent</strong> element!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>vertical-align\n<ul>\n<li><strong>vertically</strong> align any inline or inline-block element, relative to its siblings</li>\n<li>put this on the element itself!!! unlike text-align, which you put on the parent</li>\n<li>this does not, unfortunately, vertically center text inside a larger container</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>box-sizing\n<ul>\n<li>see in the top gotchas/oddities</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Also, read about “flexbox”, or “css display flex”</h4>\n<p>And learn about its related properties, which can be used to build dynamic, responsive, flexible layouts, and center content on the page - horizontally and vertically: <code>flex-direction</code>, <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>align-items</code>, <code>justify-content</code>, etc.</p>\n",

      "content": "# Consider [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)  \n  \n### Lately, I've had trouble with both Sublime Text and Vs Code.  \n  \n**VsCode** just does not indent JSX correctly, no matter what options I set, using the popular plugin \"js-beautify\" or \"prettier\" or the default formatter. After figuring out the best plugin and settings - it still sometimes breaks JSX.  \n  \n**Sublime Text** can format JSX using \"Sublime-HTMLPrettify\", but with this I could not enable \"format on save\" no matter what I did. It can do format on save with \"js-beautify\", but then it mangles JSX even worse than in VsCode (using the same engine and same .jsbeautifyrc file).  \n  \nThis has been spurred by the **Prettier** plugin for Sublime text being broken recently. It had a bad release, and it took me forever to figure out that was actually the problem, because I have just come back to React programming after doing other things, so did not remember every setting. I tried every other plugin, switched to VsCode and messed around with that, but VsCode had its own issues. Even if I get Prettier to work again, it would be too little too late.  \n  \nWhat do you use? I will be asking around. Meanwhile...  \n  \n  \n### WebStorm simply works,  \n**and I have confidence that it will still behave a year from now.**  \n  \nIt indents JSX correctly every time, and has program settings which all actually do what they're supposed to when you change them. WebStorm is a good little robot that does as you command it.  \n  \nAlso, it lets you choose to put arguments on the same line as the brackets, or each on its own line. This is huge for readability. Sometimes one format is more legible. Other times it's not. Now you, the human, can decide which to use.  \n  \nExamples at the bottom of this page.  \n  \n  \n### Other benefits...  \n  \nIt has several more sophisticated features - ones you would have to spend a long time finding and configuring just right in open source editors.  \n  \n* When you re-name a file or folder, it can search all the source code in the project, and rename any references to that file, to prevent broken links.  \n  \n* Key mapping has a very easy search interface. Feel free to remap all your favorite shortcuts, including Macros.  \n  \n* Pressing \"Backspace\" (Delete on Mac) when all you have to the left is whitespace, WebStorm deletes all the way to the end of the previous line, with one key stroke.  \n    * Vs Code deletes one indentation level at a time, then you must press again to delete the new line  \n    * Sublime Text actually is even worse. When indenting using spaces (for example 4), instead of deleting 4 spaces at a time, it deletes one space at a time.  \n  \n* Lint tooltips are easier to use and read  \n  \n* Syntax highlighting - customizing the scheme takes a bit of getting used to when coming from Sublime/VsCode. But it has more powerful and more sophisticated syntax coloring! For example, WebStorm is smart enough to color function curly brackets differently than React variable curly brackets which contain the function.  \n  \n  \n### Unfortunately,  \n* It costs $130+. But, if you are trying to get paid for the code you write, then you can't afford not to use this. I have seen a productivity increase after just a couple days of getting used to it.  \n  \n  \n### Code Example 1 (JSX)  \n**Worst case scenario** (SublimeText using JsBeautify):  \nTotally broken.  \n```  \n    Options.push( <  \n        option value = {  \n            option  \n        } > {  \n            option  \n        } <  \n        /option>  \n    );  \n```  \n**Best case scenario** (VsCode using Prettier or default or JsBeautify):  \nNotice the broken indentation. Also, why is that `<SuggestedRow...` indented by 2 spaces, while others by 4 spaces? Idk.  \n```  \n    SuggestedSelects.push(  \n      <SuggestRow  \n                    words={lists}  \n                    domains={domains}  \n                />  \n    );  \n```  \n<br /><br />  \n  \n  \n### Code Example 2 (code blocks: imports, if/else, functions, etc)  \nLong-form:  \n```  \nimport {  \n  ValidateForm,  \n  ValidateField,  \n  ValidateButton,  \n  validations  \n} from 'src/containers/validateForm';  \n```  \nShort-form:  \n```  \nimport { ValidateForm, ValidateField, ValidateButton, validations } from 'src/containers/validateForm';  \n```  \nImagine many of these imports.  \n**WebStorm** allows you to use either format. You just code it. WebStorm will detect which format you're using, and fix your indentation and spaces accordingly. VsCode and others force you to use the longer one, unless you specify in the setting to always use the all-in-line version.  \n**Same case for open/closed functions and if statements.** Now you can choose how to organize the code.  \n <br /><br /><br />  \n  \n # Getting Started with WebStorm  \n  \n ### Hints:  \nDisable all unnecessary left/bottom/top menus, to have a clean interface.  \nIn file browser left column, open file with one click instead of two:  \n```  \n    Project settings [...] > Autoscroll to source  \n```  \n Best syntax highlighting:  \n ```  \n    WebStorm > Preferences > Editor > Color Scheme > General > \"Monokai Pro\"  \n```  \nInstall **Material Theme** when first installing WebStorm, or as a Plugin. Material refers to the WebStorm application UI (not the code/text) styling. Theme refers to the header,menus,file browser, status bar, etc. Use this Material `One Dark` \"Theme\" to nicely match the Monokai \"Scheme\" above.  \n  \n### Import Settings:  \nIncludes auto-format macro and key binding `Cmd + S` to Esc, Format, Save.  \nAlso key binding `Cmd + D` to do incremental find + add word to multiple cursor, like in Sublime/VsCode.  \nAnd theme/colors/plugins.  \n[WebStormSettings](../../assets/files/WebStormSettings.zip)  \n```  \n    File > Import Settings  \n```  \n**Keyboard shortcuts (for above settings file)**  \n* Ctrl + F        ~ new folder  \n* Ctrl + N        ~ new file  \n* Ctrl + R        ~ rename file/folder  \n ",
