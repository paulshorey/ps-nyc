        <h3>Open Office space is cheaper per employee,</h3>
<p>but if you‚Äôre trying to develop top-quality high-end applications, and have millions in investment capital, can‚Äôt you afford more private spaces? Probably. But why bother? Doesn‚Äôt everyone prefer the open office? Not anyone I‚Äôve ever talked to. Everyone seems afraid to disagree, to be unrealistic, and is choosing their battles.</p>
<h3>In an open office environment, there is no place where someone can really focus and concentrate.</h3>
<p>Every space is a public meeting with the entire company. Others people talking, <strong>laughing loudly,</strong> joking, or discussing, is heard by everyone else. It is a very stressful environment that modern laborers have to deal with. The alternative is to be ousted from their otherwise comfortable (and highpaying) jobs. <strong>Dealing with the stress and distractions is better than the alternative, but we can do even better.</strong></p>
<h3>We have tools to communicate more efficiently online than in person:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Slack</strong> ~ it can be used for more than sharing GIFs. We can actually send links, code snippets, files, and have team discussions on it. This is more useful than standing around in person, where people often can‚Äôt remember the details of what they‚Äôre communicating, and are unable to convey specifics like links, diagrams, and data structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hangouts</strong>/<strong>Zoom</strong>/<strong>Skype</strong> ~ more than face to face with audio meetings, we can actually do screen shares, even take over each others‚Äô computers. That is amazing technology, and is even more productive than two people looking at one‚Äôs computer sharing the mouse/keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GIT</strong> ~ we really don‚Äôt need to solve merge conflicts face to face anymore. Embrace the green/red highlighted lines in a diff or merge request. We can make notes and annotations for each line of code in a merge request, or in a merge conflict, for others to read and discuss, or change their code accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kanban boards</strong> ~ JIRA/Trello/Asana/Basecamp, there are so many of them, and more coming out every year. In conjunction with Slack and Email, this is an extremely productive way to communicate progress and goals, for the team and beetween individual collaborators. You can still meet in person, but how many times have you forgotten what you agreed to do in a meeting. Having meetings online, you can immediately make or edit a task for what you‚Äôre talking about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calendar</strong>/<strong>Email</strong> ~ calendar events are great for more than just physical meetings. You can actually schedule online meetings just as well! Even better than specifying a physical place to meet, which in my experience is often overbooked by some more important team (CEO, sales)‚Ä¶ an online meeting room will never be occupied, so you will never be delayed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If I must work onsite and the company only has open office spaces, then please just give me a cubicle in the warehouse, or please put me in the janitor‚Äôs closet. As long as I have my external monitor and ergonomic keyboard, I‚Äôll do just fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Of course, the best thing is to have private work spaces, where one can hear himself think.</strong> These private spaces also serve as tiny conference rooms, where the worker can get together with one or two team mates, and discuss stuff without having to shout over the entire office.</p>
