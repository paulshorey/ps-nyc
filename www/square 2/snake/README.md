MODIFIED for MOBILE DEVICES + CLICK / TAP controls:
By Paul Shorey
http://paulshorey.com
Tweaked UI, controls, made it work and look better on different size screens, and mainly, added click/tap functionality so it may be played on mobile devices, though the zoom/scale needs to be tuned.
  
This was a fun project, still need to:
	1) adjust the viewport without breaking gameplay
	2) add "pause" button for mobile
	3) cleanup all that spaghetti

Compared to original (didn't use mouse / tap, would break on different size screens)
