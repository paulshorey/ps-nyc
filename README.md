## WEB DEVELOPMENT KNOWLEDGEBASE         
Created from markdown files right here in `./docs` folder.         
Currently using and contributing to `markdown-folder-to-html` project.         
Can be included in any project, as NPM module. I'm already doing so in a couple personal and client projects.
