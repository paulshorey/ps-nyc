### Been a while since I made this... 
* myself or anyone else using this as a starter might need a refresher how to work with Node and Gulp...  
### 
 
### To run Develpment environment:
* use Node version 5 or 6 (doesn't work with v9, 7 and 8 not tested)
* npm install (first, if haven't done so already) 
* gulp watch (to run dev environment)
* gulp (to simply build once, and it's done)
* then, run "node app.js" from this folder, to start the dev server at http://localhost:2080
* note: whenever you make a change to html or css or js, you have to manually refresh the page
### 

### To publish to Production:
* this is a very simple and quick site - nothing fancy
* simply run "gulp" to convert all SCSS to CSS, and it's ready to upload
* public web server root is /www, you know, the folder that has index.html :)
