The team is made up of hardworking people from all over the world. We work from London, San Francisco, Boston, Colorado and New York, and as well as collaborate with folks remote across the United States. We welcome people from all backgrounds.</p><p>\nWe represent a wide range of experience and interests, and we all agree to do three things well:</p><ul><li><p>\nWe strive to build a strong team that allows us to do and learn more than we could as individuals. Being inclusive is a part of our team's culture and community.</p></li><li><p>\nWe collaborate to create a codebase that is a joy to work in and will be for years to come. We have a strong commitment to accessibility. Let's be responsible together.</p></li><li><p>\nOur goal is for Twitter to be one of the world's most performant web apps/PWAs. Speed is a crucial feature for everyone, and we measure our success by the performance of our application.</p></li></ul><p>\nWe're a thoughtful and motivated team, that despite being relatively small, has a large impact on the world and the company. Your skill and passion will be appreciated and rewarded here.</p><p><b>\nWho You Are</b></p><ul><li><p>\nFirst off, you don’t need a Computer Science degree to apply. We encourage people from both CS and non-CS backgrounds with equivalent work experience to apply.</p></li><li><p>\nYou are an engineer with 2+ years experience in industry.</p></li><li><p>\nNot only strong technically, you have shown that you can work effectively with product managers, designers and other engineering teams.</p></li><li><p>\nYou have a fierce sense of ownership, caring deeply about the quality of everything that you deliver into your customers' hands.</p></li><li><p>\nYou love the challenge of engineering, and are confident in your ability to bring clarity and direction to ambiguous problem spaces.</p></li><li><p>\nYou work well in a fast paced environment while deeply investing in long term quality and efficiency.</p></li><li><p>\nYou're passionate about teaching: We put a high value on learning from each other. You should be skilled at pairing, teaching and sharing things that you've learned.</p></li><li><p>\nYou've got empathy and self-awareness: The foundational trust of all strong teams relies on understanding yourself and others.</p></li><li><p>\nYou work as part of a team, including engineers in remote offices</p></li><li><p>\nYou take a collaborative approach to work and can incorporate feedback from product, design and your engineering peers</p></li><li><p>\nYou care about web accessibility: we want to reach everyone everywhere!</p></li></ul><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nWhat You’ll Do</b></p><p>\nWe want you to find work that aligns with both your career goals and the goals we have for twitter.com. Below are the kind of things we would like you to work on:</p><ul><li><p>\nGet to know your peer developers to understand their challenges in day to day work so that you can move quickly and with empathy to improve all aspects of their work.</p></li><li><p>\nWork with Twitter's infrastructure to ensure that our Node server is running efficiently, our work can be reused by others across the company (or world), and explore opportunities for using our work in new ways (e.g what would it look like for us to support a server rendered tweet?)</p></li><li><p>\nWork closely with teams across product engineering, product management and design to build features that affect millions of users daily.</p></li><li><p>\nThis job is more than JavaScript. Your non-coding skills (Communication, Mentoring, Project Management, etc) are very important. We believe that leadership comes from everywhere, and it's important that our Senior Developers have the skills to lead complex projects successfully within a large organization.</p></li><li><p>\nFamiliarity with or interest in learning any of the following is a plus: React, Webpack, Babel, ES6, Node/Express, SSR, React Native, Redux, React Router, GraphQL</p></li></ul><p><b>\nQualifications</b></p><ul><li><p>\nB.S. or higher in Computer Science (or equivalent work experience)</p></li></ul><p><b>\nNice to Haves</b></p><ul><li><p>\nGreat communication and documentation abilities</p></li><li><p>\nExperience working with accessibility issues</p></li><li><p>\nData-informed product development: analytics, A/B testing, etc.</p></li><li><p>\nLinks to open source contributions or any public code</p></li></ul><p>\nIf this sounds like a team you want to be a part of, great!

In this new world, employees and employers are facing new challenges. Work culture is rapidly evolving and leaders are trying to determine how to take care of their teams.

A product-zeitgeist fit exists, and Caroo is focused on becoming the market leader in this new world of work.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nCaroo curates healthier snacks, premium gifts, and team building experiences which it is delivering via its own software and technology platform. The shift comes after the dramatic shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because work is far less office-centric, it has launched such products as an Inspire Collection and Amplify Box, products which are designed to help work-from-anywhere employees feel inspired, cared for, and appreciated. Those offerings include curated healthy snacks and beverages, gifts, and team-building experiences all designed to connect employees, recognize them (celebrations, anniversaries, birthdays, onboarding), and nourish them month-over-month.</div><div></div><br>\n<div><b>\nThe Role:</b></div><div>\nCaroo is looking for a highly skilled, and motivated technologist looking for a new, exciting project that will challenge you to become a better engineer while also helping millions of people across America live healthier.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nWith a deep understanding of software technologies, you’ll leverage your technical expertise in architecture, frameworks, scalability, performance, unit testing, observability, and more.

You will be encouraged to engage in high-level technical decision making, and there will be leadership roles available to early hires as the company continues to expand.</li>\n<li>Enjoy working from home? Coffee-shops? Co-working spaces? Pick any of the above! Our team is fully remote.</li>\n<li>We have an engineering team culture centered on open-communication, honest feedback, and personal responsibility. You will not be micromanaged.</li>\n<li>Our codebases are clean, performant, and well tested. We believe that the best solution is often the simplest, that writing good tests saves time and effort in the long run, and that code should be written with a focus on readability.</li>\n<li>The Chipper team is truly global - on a daily basis, you might be interacting with team members in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Brazil, Accra, Lagos, and Nairobi.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Qualifications</b></p>\n<p>\nWe don't care very much about checking boxes, such as \"X years of experience\" or \"Familiarity with X framework\" to show that you're qualified for this role. We're looking for talented, passionate engineers, who enjoy writing clean, well structured, and well-tested code. An ideal team member will be self-driven, will enjoy owning their own projects, and will be able to constructively communicate with the rest of the team in order to brainstorm, disambiguate project specifications, and to give (and receive) feedback on everything from coding style to high-level architecture and design. Most importantly, we're looking for engineers who love learning.</p>\n<p><b>\nWhat You'll Work On</b></p>\n<p>\nWe don't tend to define rigid roles for engineers within our team - the projects that you work on will largely be driven by your own areas of interest. Here are some examples of roles that you might fill on the team:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build out beautiful user interfaces and experiences within the Chipper Cash mobile application, working closely with UX designers and researchers to make the app silky smooth and easy to use - even for users who might be using a smartphone for the first time!</li>\n<li>Implement new features across the full stack, delivering massive impact by iterating rapidly on the frontend and backend and delivering critical new functionality to the end user.</li>\n<li>Architect new services and functionality on the backend, utilizing cutting edge technologies such as high-throughput messaging queues to build out performant, fault-tolerant systems with a focus on elegance and simplicity.</li>\n<li>Comb through tens of millions of data points, discovering new insights and building advanced algorithms (incorporating machine learning techniques) to solve tough issues such as fraud detection and identity verification.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Our Tech Stack</b></p>\n<p>\nThe more familiarity you have with our tech stack, the better! That being said, familiarity with our stack is not a requirement - if you're an excellent engineer, we don't think you'll have any trouble ramping up on any of these technologies that you're less familiar with. The technologies that we use include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React Native</li>\n<li>Node.js</li>\n<li>Modern Javascript (ES8) &amp; Typescript</li>\n<li>PostgreSQL</li>\n<li>RabbitMQ</li>\n<li>Python + Jupyter Notebooks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next Steps</p>\n<p>\nIf you feel you are a good fit, please apply because we would love to hear from you.

These are the people who power the App Store, Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books. And they do it on a massive scale, meeting Apple’s high expectations with high performance to deliver a huge variety of entertainment in over 35 languages to more than 150 countries. These engineers build secure, end-to-end solutions. They develop the custom software used to process all the creative work, the tools that providers use to deliver that media, all the server-side systems, and the APIs for many Apple services. Thanks to Apple’s unique integration of hardware, software, and services, engineers here partner to get behind a single unified vision.
