IC role, target is to build and deploy better looking Event management UIs then exist on the market and set a front-end standard for our company (http://www.blackthorn.io).<br>\n</p>\n<p></p><p><b>Location</b><br>\nOverlapping most EST hours<br>\n<br>\n<b>Report to</b><br>\nDirector of Platform Engineering<br>\n<br>\n<b>Description</b><br>\nYou're exceptional with building application front-ends with a keen eye for UI and UX. You're not a UI/UX designer, but you know a bad experience when you see one with ideas on how to correct them. You're a specialist. You can work with any front-end language, not just React vs Angular. You have a public profile of personal projects you've worked on, simply because you love it. You'll make magic happen with our Events app (https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000EX3qVUAT)'s attendee facing UIs, for responsive desktop/mobile and our forthcoming mobile app.<br>\n<br>\nYou're someone who'll try to do something even if it doesn't make sense all for the sake of comparison and feedback.<br>\n<br>\nYour vision will guide the direction of our company. You should be a progressive and modern thinker.<br>\n</p>\n<p><b>Why is our work important\n</b><br>\nOur apps provide our customers what they're looking for with Events and Payments without being hard to set up. Most apps in our space take weeks to implement, ours take hours, and they work more flexibly, achieving significantly more functionality than our competitors.</p>\n<p></p><p><b>Trajectory\n</b><br>\nIC (individual Contributor) or Management.

We'll be building new UIs for our products, focusing on our Events UIs, across multiple front-end languages, working with our now-hiring-for UI/UX designer. You'll have ownership over the front-end architecture, under the approval of our CTO.</p>\n<p></p><p><b>Responsibilities</b></p>\n<ul><li>Build new and modify existing event interfaces. Lists, calendars, overviews/landing/detail pages, and new concepts. Example of today: https://events.blackthorn.io/1UDqJh6/</li><li>\nWork closely with our product team</li><li>\nBuild anything else asked of you without ever just agreeing, always chime in with your opinion of what you're building and voice your technical approach.

At the time their mission was to provide easy and affordable access to public records. Something that in 2007, was only really accessible to corporations. Since then their mission has expanded to developing products and services that grant access to information and data across a number of verticals. In service of this mission, LTV has 7 consumer brands including BeenVerified, NumberGuru, PeopleLooker, NeighborWho, Ownerly, PeopleSmart, and Bumper.</p><p>\nOur mission is to develop a diverse portfolio of technologies, products, and services, that gives all people equal access to unbiased data and information. We believe that through this access people can empower and protect themselves in today’s ever-changing world, filled with fake news, deception, and a lack of transparency.</p><p>\nPowered by JazzHR</p><p>\n39PkmKQjfM</p></div></div><div class=\"mosaic-zone\" id=\"mosaic-zone-belowFullJobDescription\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                try {\n                    window.mosaic.onMosaicApiReady(function() {\n                        var zoneId = 'belowFullJobDescription';\n                        var providers = window.mosaic.zonedProviders[zoneId];\n\n                        if (providers) {\n                            providers.filter(function(p) { return window.mosaic.lazyFns[p]; }).forEach(function(p) {\n                                return window.mosaic.api.loadProvider(p);\n                            });\n                        }\n                    });\n                 } catch (e) {};\n                </script>",

It was always an employee care company,” said Sean Kelly, Caroo’s CEO.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nWe now live in a work-from-anywhere economy. In this new world, employees and employers are facing new challenges. Work culture is rapidly evolving and leaders are trying to determine how to take care of their teams. Outdated and expensive employee care solutions focus solely on the physical office space and are one-size-fits-all. Only one option exists to provide economical, personalized care in the work-from-anywhere world, which requires data, AI and forecasting to be most effective and efficient.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nTo take advantage of this opportunity and leverage the company's current positioning and core competencies, Caroo is expanding beyond food and drink delivery to become a software-enabled employee care platform that will manage and deliver all of a company's tangible care needs. Over the past few months, the company has already signed up more than 3,000 new enterprise clients with their various wellness box solutions. A product-zeitgeist fit exists, and Caroo is focused on becoming the market leader in this new world of work.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nCaroo curates healthier snacks, premium gifts, and team building experiences which it is delivering via its own software and technology platform. The shift comes after the dramatic shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because work is far less office-centric, it has launched such products as an Inspire Collection and Amplify Box, products which are designed to help work-from-anywhere employees feel inspired, cared for, and appreciated. Those offerings include curated healthy snacks and beverages, gifts, and team-building experiences all designed to connect employees, recognize them (celebrations, anniversaries, birthdays, onboarding), and nourish them month-over-month.</div><div></div><br>\n<div><b>\nThe Role:</b></div><div>\nCaroo is looking for a highly skilled, and motivated technologist looking for a new, exciting project that will challenge you to become a better engineer while also helping millions of people across America live healthier.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nWith a deep understanding of software technologies, you’ll leverage your technical expertise in architecture, frameworks, scalability, performance, unit testing, observability, and more.

We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the TODAY Show, The View, and Good Morning America many times. We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 60 employees and $50M annual revenue since 2013.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nWe are 100% Remote</b></h2>\n<p>\nAs a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. Collage.com's co-founders/co-CEOs both come from a technical background and believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy - it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nThe Role</b></h2>\n<p>\nWe are seeking an ambitious and nice senior front-end engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team's growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you.</p>\n<p>\nLearn more about working and developing software at Collage.com.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nResponsibilities</b></h2>\n<ul><li>Write and maintain front-end JavaScript code as part of a mobile-first web application, including UI components and state management logic.</li>\n<li>Make decisions about code design, architecture, and refactoring to balance technical debt against delivering functionality.</li>\n<li>Plan and lead testing for complex projects.</li>\n<li>Review code and mentor other engineers.</li>\n<li>Provide time estimates and participate in agile development.</li>\n<li>Review specifications and work with PMs to implement lean methodology.</li>\n</ul><h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>Required Qualifications</b></h2>\n<ul><li>Experience implementing and testing advanced JavaScript code on a team as part of a production web or mobile application</li>\n<li>Practical experience with MV* architecture (such as Backbone, Vue, React + Redux/Mobx, etc.), unidirectional data flow, and minimal class/object interfaces</li>\n<li>Spatial/geometric reasoning ability - for rendering, animation, and image manipulation</li>\n<li>Ability to quickly understand and work with unfamiliar complex code</li>\n<li>Pro-active and clear communication is essential for this remote work position</li>\n</ul><h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>Benefits and Perks</b></h2>\n<ul><li>Working from home makes it easier to focus on results and develop professionally while spending less time commuting.

Because you will be working remotely, all of our interviews are done remotely. We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills who embody our company values (which can be found on our careers page).</p>\n<p>\nDuring the interview process, you will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speak to a member of our talent acquisition team which will be mostly an experience and values/culture fit assessment</li>\n<li>Complete a shorter coding task that includes questions in Javascript and focuses on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios</li>\n<li>Speak with a Senior/Lead engineer</li>\n<li>Complete a more complex technical challenge that is intended to emulate your actual work environment</li>\n<li>Speak with our VP of engineering and both founders/CEOs of the company</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you'd like to meet before accepting an offer.

We mainly use JavaScript technologies like Node on the back-end, and frameworks on the front-end like React, Vue, Ember, or Angular. We’re more interested in your deep understanding of web development and development concepts like code architecture, maintainability, and best practices, than we are if you know a particular framework or technology we are using.</p><p>While we know how to have fun, our work culture is based around professionalism and respect for each other. As such, we’ve described our ideal candidates as “studio-musician developers” instead of “rock-star developers.” The ability to work and communicate well with a team is critical. If you can stay focused and get work done on a reasonable schedule, that is more important to our team than the ability to soldier through long hours. While every job requires bursts of workload from time to time, we view “crunchtime” as a process failure, not a badge of honor.</p><p>We work on a variety of projects, but are hiring specifically for a project that uses the following technologies:</p><ul><li>Node.js</li><li>Ember.js</li></ul><p>We are a side-project friendly engineering company with an IP clause that allows employees to confidently retain ownership over their personal Intellectual Property.</p><p>Responsibilities</p><ul><li>Develop software applications using best practices in coordination with a distributed team.</li><li>Review teammates' code (we use pull requests).</li><li>Help plan &amp; roadmap new features and functionality.</li></ul><p>Qualifications</p><ul><li>5+ years as a professional software engineer.</li><li>Ability to architect complex software features and functionality in a maintainable, DRY, abstract, and modular way.</li><li>Ability to design an execution plan for the aforementioned functionality (we use JIRA but an understanding of any task management software is fine).</li><li>Knowledge of MVC or similar architectural patterns.</li><li>Expert understanding of JavaScript and asynchronous code.</li><li>Expert understanding of web development concepts, such as how to write best practices code, various persistence layer technologies (SQL, NoSQL, etc), queues, infrastructure architecture (including cloud based), scaling systems, debugging, tests, version control, a deep understanding of http, etc.</li><li>Understanding of the full web development stack. You may be better at one end of the stack, but you would be able to develop and deploy a complex web application from the ground up alone if you had to.</li><li>Ability to work at a steady pace instead of procrastination leading to long hours and burnout.</li><li>Belief that learning is one of the best properties of the software engineering profession.</li><li>Ability to communicate and work well with a team (this is critical for the success of our distributed engineering team).</li></ul><p>Technologies we use and would love to see you have experience with (but we realize the right candidate can learn new technologies quickly anyways)</p><ul><li>Node.js.</li><li>React.js, Vue.js, Ember.js, Angular (we’d love you to have experience with at least one newer front-end framework).</li><li>Postgresql, MySql, MongoDB, Redis.</li><li>Build tools like Webpack, Grunt, etc.</li><li>React Native.</li><li>Python</li><li>Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform.</li><li>Docker, Containerization technologies.</li><li>Any technology you are passionate about and want to share with us!</li></ul><p>We are an equal opportunity employer.

We’re heavy DTC advertisers and our success is linked to how well our web and mobile acquisition funnels convert. So, we’ve created a standalone digital optimization SWAT team that can focus exclusively on iterating rapidly with high volume conversion rate optimization (CRO) testing. If you’re obsessed with creating the perfect user experience, love to contribute your ideas and get a thrill when your test wins, please read on.\n</p><p><b>Who Are We?</b>\n</p><p>Metabolic Living is a self-funded, profitable, rapidly growing multi-channel DTC health and wellness company with 100+ on our team and on pace to hit $50MM in 2020. For the last 9 years we’ve been quietly developing our metabolic optimization products and fine-tuning our business model. Everything is now clicking, so we’re stepping on the gas as we march towards our goal of becoming a billion-dollar multi-channel brand by 2024. <b>We’ve always </b><b>been 100% remote and will stay that way</b><b> as we scale.</b>\n</p><p>We’re fortunate to be thriving during these challenging COVD times as we provide exactly what everyone wants. The overall trend towards health and wellness was already a wind in our sails, but COVID lit a match and set our growth on fire, dramatically accelerating things. This is your opportunity to help us make a meaningful impact, precisely at the time when the world needs it the most.\n</p><p><b>What are the Key Points?</b>\n</p><ul><li><b>Compensation</b>: $110,000 - $135,000 (plus bonus)\n</li><li><b>Location</b>: 100% Remote (virtual team of 100+ with no corporate office)\n</li><li><b>Benefits</b>: Health/Dental/Vision/Disability/Life + Robust 401k + 15 Days PTO\n</li><li><b>Hours</b>: 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EASTERN (regardless of where you live)\n</li></ul><ul><li><b>Culture</b>: Human-first with High-Performing, Happy &amp; Humble People (no jerks)\n</li><li><b>Personality</b>: Obsessed with Distilling the Complex into the Simple<br>\n</li></ul><p><br>\n<b>What’s the Big Opportunity?</b>\n</p><p><b>Hello, my name is Kaitlin Reiss, Head of Ecommerce at Metabolic Living, and I need your help. </b>We’ve hired the leader of our digital optimization team who has 3,200 split tests under his belt (yes, really!). And now we’re recruiting the remaining pieces of this world-class team as we get ready to launch two major strategic initiatives to introduce our new brand: our state-of-the-art e-commerce website and customized metabolic optimization app that leverages machine learning and AI. We couldn’t be more excited to build this dedicated digital optimization team because it means we can move lightning fast.\n</p><p>If you’re as obsessed with testing as I am, this is a dream-scenario. I joined the company because I wanted to be part of building their new brand, to build something special, to build it the <i>right</i> way. But building things the right way is a constant process of optimization. And to do that we need the help of a world-class UI/UX front-end developer who can help us rapidly iterate.\n</p><p>That’s why this is a fantastic opportunity for someone with an inquisitive, consumer-oriented mindset who’s oozing with ideas and obsessed with creating amazing user experiences that convert like crazy. You get annoyed when pixels aren’t perfect and when UXs and UIs don’t make sense… and scratch your head when you buy something on another website or app and wonder why their checkout process is so inefficient! You love to get creative and your first instinct at a challenge is never “it can’t be done” but rather “I’ll figure it out” … and then you deliver and make it happen.\n</p><p>Sure, we need someone who can carve up mockups… but were looking for so much more. We want your ideas! We want to tap into your creative problem-solving brain to improve overall usability and to smartly leverage technology to make everything faster, more scalable, smoother, and easier. You’ll work with the CRO director, UX/UI designer, copywriter and other SWAT team members to develop hypotheses, propose treatments, collaboratively build tests, analyze results for key learnings and repeat.\n</p><p>Your days will be exciting and filled with variety. One day you might be optimizing a quiz in our performance funnels… another day you may be optimizing a checkout or upsell page our e-comm website… another day you might be optimizing the onboarding experience in our customized metabolic optimization app.\n</p><p><b>What’s Our Culture Like?</b>\n</p><p>We’re serious about high-performance, <b>so our culture is built around deep work</b> to allow uninterrupted time for the intense concentration needed to deliver world-class performance. At the same time, real collaboration and transparency is critical to keep us all in alignment and keep office politics out of the equation. These aren’t just talking points – we’ve implemented specific policies, for example:\n</p><ul><li>A standardized 8:30 to 5:00 p.m. ET schedule to protect your <b>personal and family time</b>\n</li><li>No meetings before 1 p.m. ET to empower you with 4 hours truly of <b>deep work to GSD</b>\n</li><li>Daily huddles and weekly 1-on-1s to support your ability to <b>focus on what matters most</b><br>\n</li></ul><p><br>\n<b>Should You Apply?</b>\n</p><p>If after reading this it’s screaming “this is for me” and…\n</p><ul><li>You LOVE split testing and are completely addicted to testing and learning…\n</li><li>You LOVE tinkering with user interfaces until they’re just right…\n</li><li>You LOVE writing clean, efficient code that turns Zeplin mockups into pixel-perfect executions…\n</li><li>You LOVE figuring out how to create fast-loading websites and apps with the best tech…\n</li><li>You LOVE being part of a cross-functional high-performing team that moves fast…<br>\n</li></ul><p><br>\nThen please read on as you’re the ideal candidate… and we’d love to talk to you ASAP.\n</p><p><b>What Does Metabolic Living Do?</b>\n</p><p>The most common question we get is – what the heck do you do? Because from the outside in, unless you’re a customer, it can be confusing, There’s a reason: We built everything organically in reverse, starting with our first nutrition program in 2012, then our first exercise program in 2014 and then launching our full ecosystem of products, including nutraceuticals, functional foods, subscriptions, memberships, 1-on-1 coaching and more. These are all marketed separately under different DTC websites and brands in a direct response (DR) manner.\n</p><p>And now we’re centralizing everything under our new brand, Metabolic Living, with our flagship website and app launching later this year, transitioning us from purely DR to a multi-channel traditional brand. The website at metabolicliving.com is a temporary one for COVID to raise $45k for frontline health workers. This website will be replaced with the fully branded e-commerce-driven one soon.\n</p><p>Normally, companies launch with a brand and then figure out how to make money. We did that in reverse – pinpointing pain points, curating world-class products, validating product-market match, generating cash flow to self-fund our growth, creating our north star (see more below), building out our operational team along the way and then retrofitting the brand on top. Strange path, but here we are. Read our full story here: https://www.linkedin.com/company/metabolic-living/about/.\n</p><p>We provide the full ecosystem of products and services that help you quickly optimize your metabolism so you can feel, look and perform your best, every day… yet without the yo-yo struggle of traditional approaches. Rather than a one-sized-fits-all approach like Paleo, Vegan, Keto, etc. we empower you with a flexible <i>framework</i> called our <i>Metabolic OS</i><i>TM</i> that’s 100% customized to you. It allows you to get results fast and to sustain those results as your body, mind and daily life changes as you age.

Each month, we perform a combination of routine maintenance and new development for these clients. We answer their questions, help them when they need help, and make sure they feel supported. Over time, we build close relationships with these clients, many of whom have happily been working with us for five to ten years. If we keep these clients happy, they eventually decide to rebuild their website (or web application), and they come to us to help them with that.</p><p>\nThe other 60% of our revenue comes from new project work. We rarely take on startup projects, and instead focus on building things for established companies and non-profits. We also do a lot of work on grant-funded, academic projects. This project work generally leads to new retainers when it's completed.</p><p>\nThis is where you come in. We've reached a point where we need to formalize the services we deliver under these retainer agreements. Your job will involve managing the work to be done for retainer clients each month. When the request is within your abilities, you'll go ahead and do the development yourself. If the request requires a more senior developer, your job will involve communicating with the client to understand the requirements, handing the request off to a senior developer, assisting with development where appropriate, making sure the request gets resolved, and communicating the resolution back to the client. If you have free time, you'll work on our internal tools for automating some of the services we provide under these retainers.</p><p><b>\nAbout Cast Iron Coding</b></p><p>\nCast Iron Coding is a web development studio. We build things—CMS driven websites, small brochure sites, large open-source applications, internal business web applications, backend APIs—for our clients. While we regularly use a variety of frontend and backend languages and technologies, all of our projects are built on the core web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Consequently, most, but not all, of our projects run in a browser.<br>\n</p><p>\nUnlike many firms that turn jobs around quickly and move on to the next project, we're in it for the long haul with all our clients, so we care a great deal about the craft that goes into what we build. We've been building web sites, web apps, and mobile apps since about 2004, for a wide variety of clients.</p><p>\nIf you took a snapshot of what we're working on <i>right now</i>, you'd see a company willing to take on a variety of different kinds of projects, including:</p><ul>\n<li>We're building an open source, academic publishing platform called Manifold under a Mellon Foundation grant.</li>\n<li>We just finished building a web application that helps Oregonians facing food insecurity find food assistance sites.</li>\n<li>We're building new sites for an art gallery in New York City and for a large animal rescue operation in CA.</li>\n<li>We're building a dashboard for a fortune 500 company that helps employees track the publication and performance of thousands of online resources</li>\n<li>We're doing a new round of development on a web app that encourages people to change their behavior so that it's more eco-friendly and sustainable.</li>\n<li>We're getting started on a project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) that digitizes and visualizes thousands of hand-written responses provided by soldiers returning from WWII.</li>\n</ul><p>One of the true pleasures of working at Cast Iron Coding is that we work on projects that interest us across a wide variety of sectors. We like working with small businesses, academics, nonprofits, and organizations we admire. But we also like sinking our teeth into a thorny, difficult enterprise project where revenue is at stake. We love a big challenge, and problems that make us think hard about what we're building. We've been at this long enough now—about 15 years—and we've resisted growing fast or sacrificing quality. Our clients speak highly of us and, perhaps a better metric, our past employees who've moved on to greener pastures still come back to hang out and grab a beer with the team.</p><p><b>\nEqual Opportunity</b></p><p>\nLet's face it. The field we work in—tech generally, programming specifically—has a diversity problem. Like many in the industry, we'd like to see this change. Cast Iron Coding is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to the principle of diversity. As such, we are particularly interested in receiving applications from a broad spectrum of people.<br>\n</p><p><b>\nRequirements</b></p><p>\nYour regular duties will include:</p><ul>\n<li>Touch base with every retainer client on a month basis and learn about their needs. You'll discuss their requests with them and set realistic expectations based on the number of hours in the retainer.</li>\n<li>Build a rapport with the client and being the face of Cast Iron for our retainer clients.</li>\n<li>At our regular meetings, keep the internal Cast Iron team up-to-date on issues that our retainer clients might be facing.</li>\n<li>Work with our scheduling lead to make sure retainer commitments are accurately represented on our agency schedule.</li>\n<li>Translate client requests to issues in our issue tracker. Maintain the issue backlogs on retainer projects.</li>\n<li>Review pull requests and test work before releasing it to staging. Make sure approved work is released to production.</li>\n<li>Communicate more complex or advanced requests to senior developers and tracking the issue.</li>\n<li>Undertake small development tasks on a variety of systems including Craft, Wordpress, October, TYPO3, and Rails.</li>\n<li>Perform monthly maintenance tasks, such as making sure the underlying platform is up-to-date, checking SSL certificate expiration, making sure backups are being run, etc. Many of these tasks are or can be automated.</li>\n<li>Help maintain our Slack bot that tracks completion of retainer tasks in an Airtable database.</li>\n<li>When retainer work is light, help out on other projects at Cast Iron as needed.</li>\n</ul><p>We're looking for applicants with the following traits:</p><ul>\n<li>You're organized and detail oriented. You stay on top of open issues and pull requests, and make sure they get resolved and released.</li>\n<li>You're a good listener and a careful communicator with strong writing skills.</li>\n<li>You're good at listening to clients and understanding their needs, plans, frustrations, etc.</li>\n<li>You're calm, patient, kind, and a pleasure to work with.</li>\n<li>You're a quick study and eager to be mentored by senior developers.</li>\n<li>You're a thoughtful, critical thinker. A computer science degree is by no means necessary for this position, but we'd like to see a college degree.</li>\n</ul><p>To be successful, you'll need to bring these skills to the position:</p><ul>\n<li>You'll need a foundation in core web technologies (HTML + CSS + JS, and some PHP)</li>\n<li>You've worked with at least one content management system (ideally Craft, Wordpress, or October)</li>\n<li>You'll be good at figuring out how to construct reproducible processes and finding more efficent ways to deliver services to our clients.</li>\n<li>You know how to work with other developers on a team and know how to track issues, adhere to shared code style and conventions; use Git for branching, merging, and rebasing; and write code that is easy to understand.</li>\n<li>Cast Iron is currently working 100% remotely due to COVID-19 and expect that we'll be remote until at least 2021, so you'll need to be comfortable working with remote clients and teammates.</li>\n<li>You should be able to read documentation and try to solve problems on your own. You also need to be able to judge when you're spinning your wheels and figure out how to formulate targeted questions directed at senior developers to help you get unstuck.</li>\n</ul><p>Bonus points if you have experience with the following:</p><ul>\n<li>React and/or advanced Javascript</li>\n<li>Ruby and/or Ruby on Rails</li>\n<li>Jenkins or other CI tools like Travis or Github Actions</li>\n<li>Popular services (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Nginx, Elasticsearch, Docker)</li>\n<li>AWS or Google Cloud Services</li>\n<li>Static site generators like Next.js or Gatsby</li>\n</ul><p><b>Benefits</b></p><ul>\n<li>You get to work with a team of programmers who are technically competent and who, additionally, bring a strong background in the humanities to their work.</li>\n<li>Our team members trust and support each other. We value mentorship and collaboration, and we support learning and experimentation. Before COVID, we'd play board games together every couple of weeks. These days, we have a great time playing D&amp;D online over Zoom.</li>\n<li>You will be given a reasonable starting salary, depending on your experience. This salary will almost certainly be less than what a startup flush with venture capital or a much larger company might offer. In return for making a little bit less money, we won't make you go to (very many) pointless meetings, and we won't expect you to give up your life outside of work to be successful at work. You'll work regular 9-5 hours, and most of your time at work will be spent feeling productive. Moreover, if you stay at CIC for a while and prosper as a developer, your salary will increase each year. In addition to your salary, you will likely receive a substantial winter bonus each year.</li>\n<li>You will receive top-notch health insurance, including dental and nontraditional medicine. CIC will pay 50% of your health insurance premium on our group plan, as well as 50% of the insurance cost for your partner and, if you have them, your children.</li>\n<li>You will have the option of enrolling in our 401k plan.</li>\n<li>You'll be offered ample vacation and sick leave. Life-work balance matters, and we try hard to help employees stay healthy and happy.</li>\n<li>You can work from home, work from the office, or a mix of the two. We recently moved out of Washington High School and are now sharing a space with Brink Communications in SE Portland until Q3, 2021. Later next year we will build out a new space that better supports the hybrid work-from-home / in-person model that we envision going forward.</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"mosaic-zone\" id=\"mosaic-zone-belowFullJobDescription\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                try {\n                    window.mosaic.onMosaicApiReady(function() {\n                        var zoneId = 'belowFullJobDescription';\n                        var providers = window.mosaic.zonedProviders[zoneId];\n\n                        if (providers) {\n                            providers.filter(function(p) { return window.mosaic.lazyFns[p]; }).forEach(function(p) {\n                                return window.mosaic.api.loadProvider(p);\n                            });\n                        }\n                    });\n                 } catch (e) {};\n                </script>",

A well written refactored code is better than just making things work. We love pairing and doing code reviews and it would be an integral part of your role.</p><p>\nIdeally, you should know how rails work in depth, be able to improve performance of a PostgreSQL query, solve scalability issues, create secure APIs and NextJS applications on top of it and practice clean architecture and clean coding philosophies.</p><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nJOB RESPONSIBILITIES + GOALS:</b></p><ul><li>\nBuild robust, fault-tolerant, and scalable React/Rails features and applications.</li><li>\nBuild new <i>ReactJS </i>based features as per stakeholders’ requirements on top of our <i>NextJS</i> Video Library app.</li><li>\nDecouple our tightly coupled Ruby on Rails-based backend for currently existing applications from the front end. Presently we have a mix of <i>React on Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and jQuery </i>working inside a rails application. This presents performance bottlenecks. We would want the rails application to expose API only which other front end apps can consume after authentication.</li><li>\nMake our backend for all apps lightweight by migrating all the <i>Sidekiq/Redis</i> jobs into <i>AWS Lambdas</i>. Presently we use <i>Heroku </i>worker dynos to run these tasks but it has its limitations. We have migrated a few of these tasks into<i> AWS lambda</i>. Being a serverless infrastructure, it has worked great for us.</li><li>\nMerge our backend applications that share a lot of common data with each other into one single application that multiple front end applications interact with. This will remove data redundancy and provide easy maintenance opportunities we presently face issues with.</li><li>\nStack upgrades fix bugs, make apps more scalable, memory efficient, and secure.</li></ul><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nQUALIFICATIONS:</b></p><ul><li>\nExpert/Adept in <i>Ruby on Rails.</i></li><li>\nExpert/Adept/Proficient in <i>ReactJS.</i></li><li>\nAdept/Proficient in <i>PSQL.</i></li><li>\nAdept/Proficient in <i>AWS infrastructure.</i></li><li>\nAdept/Proficient in <i>Elasticsearch.</i></li><li>\nHas timely delivered on successfully migrating complex legacy code to a more maintainable newer version.</li><li>\nUnderstands the value of clean code.</li><li>\nDecoupled react on rails or javascript based front end logic in ruby on rails framework and migrated it to separate front end apps.</li><li>\nHe/She Is a team player. Has worked efficiently with designers and other engineers and can pair when needed.</li><li>\nUnderstands the value of great software architectures and can give his/her suggestions in decision making.</li></ul><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nOUR VALUES as a Team!</b></p><p><b>\nAlways keep the user in mind</b></p><p>\nWe build solutions for our coworkers, partners, clients, and ourselves. In each context, we keep the individual needs of the user in mind through discovery, design, engineering, and release.</p><p><b>\nContext is key</b></p><p>\nBuilding Products is a creative process, there is no one size fits all solution. We strive to be aware of situational context when making decisions about product, priority, architecture, process.</p><p><b>\nFail Fast</b></p><p>\nMost products fail. The harder this is to accept, the more accepting it presents a strategic advantage! We strive to separate ourselves by spending as little time as possible on 'doomed' products. So we ask why the product or feature we are working on may fail. We do this to eliminate as much risk as possible for products that will make it launch and identify products that will not be viable as early as possible, ideally during discovery.</p><p><b>\nDon't reinvent the wheel</b></p><p>\nWe are very lucky to work in such an active time for information sharing. We should always consider if there is a simple open-source solution or a paid alternative to any work we take on. We prefer stable solutions, good documentation and examples, and active communities when seeking alternatives to building something ourselves.</p><p><b>\nBuild For Future Change</b></p><p>\nWhen considering future changes while developing today's roadmap, spec, or feature, we walk a fine line - fortune-telling is a tricky thing! All things being equal, we want code that is easy to change later (such code is by definition also easy to understand!). However ice-boxed work has a way of lingering, so be careful not to 'prefactor' too much, as unused code is unnecessary and confusing.</p><p><b>\nAlways be Learning</b></p><p>\nOur field evolves at a breakneck pace. Great new products, libraries, packages, practices, etc are being shared all the time. And there is bottomless depth in the fundamentals. We are dedicated to keeping up and leveling up, and helping each other along the way!</p><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nPERKS AND BENEFITS:</b></p><ul><li>\nCompetitive compensation</li><li>\nExcellent health insurance: Medical, Dental, Vision &amp; other benefits</li><li>\nGenerous paid time off policy</li><li>\n401(k) with company match</li><li>\nYear-round company activities and events</li><li>\nWeekly company-sponsored yoga/meditation</li><li>\nAnnual company retreat</li><li><b>\nAccepting candidates from any geographical location; this role is currently fully remote due to COVID-19.</b></li></ul><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nInterested candidates should apply directly through Collab's </b><b>website</b><b>.</b></p><p>\nPowered by JazzHR</p><p>\nZuuTB6jAdi</p></div></div><div class=\"mosaic-zone\" id=\"mosaic-zone-belowFullJobDescription\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                try {\n                    window.mosaic.onMosaicApiReady(function() {\n                        var zoneId = 'belowFullJobDescription';\n                        var providers = window.mosaic.zonedProviders[zoneId];\n\n                        if (providers) {\n                            providers.filter(function(p) { return window.mosaic.lazyFns[p]; }).forEach(function(p) {\n                                return window.mosaic.api.loadProvider(p);\n                            });\n                        }\n                    });\n                 } catch (e) {};\n                </script>",

We also published a blog post explaining the underlying technology.</p></li><li><p>\nOur presentation editor: Allows users to create presentations with slide themes, shapes, text, and embedded Aha! reports (which update live so the presentation is always current).</p></li><li><p>\nOur Gantt chart: Supports scaling and scrolling to change the timeline, drag-and-drop, and quick actions to create records or sort the bars.</p></li></ul>\n<p>\nWe embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us, rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.</p>\n<p>\nWe do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nYour experience</b></h2>\n<p>\nWe believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.</p>\n<p>\nAll of our engineers work across the full stack. As a Senior Front End Engineer, you can expect to spend the majority of your time working with React or HTML/CSS, but you will also be asked to write significant back end code in Ruby on Rails to support the front end features you are building.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nYour work at Aha!</b></h2>\n<p>\nWe work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:</p>\n<ul><li><p>\nImplementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</p></li><li><p>\nBuilding deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</p></li><li><p>\nWorking proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</p></li><li><p>\nOptimizing browser performance on screens and components that render large quantities of data to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</p></li><li><p>\nInterfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation</p></li><li><p>\nDocumenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency</p></li></ul>\n<p>\nIf this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)</p>\n<p>\n#LI-REMOTE</p><br>\n<div></div>\n<p>\nWe are building a distributed team, and you can work from anywhere in the United States, Canada, or Mexico for this role. We offer generous salary, equity, benefits, and a profit-sharing program.</p>\n<div><h4 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nDiversity</b></h4><p>\nWe are committed to hiring, promoting, and compensating employees based on their qualifications and demonstrated ability to perform job responsibilities. As an equal opportunity employer, Aha! welcomes all employees and applicants, without regard to age, race, color, national origin, physical or mental disability, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or veteran status, condition of pregnancy, or any other legally protected characteristic.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"mosaic-zone\" id=\"mosaic-zone-belowFullJobDescription\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                try {\n                    window.mosaic.onMosaicApiReady(function() {\n                        var zoneId = 'belowFullJobDescription';\n                        var providers = window.mosaic.zonedProviders[zoneId];\n\n                        if (providers) {\n                            providers.filter(function(p) { return window.mosaic.lazyFns[p]; }).forEach(function(p) {\n                                return window.mosaic.api.loadProvider(p);\n                            });\n                        }\n                    });\n                 } catch (e) {};\n                </script>",

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nOur team</b></h2>\n<p>\nAha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.</p>\n<ul><li><p><b>\nWe move quickly</b>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</p></li><li><p><b>\nWe collaborate</b>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</p></li><li><p><b>\nWe value product over process</b>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</p></li><li><p><b>\nWe are happy</b>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company values. Check out our generous benefits.</p></li><li><p><b>\nWe enjoy</b>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method, our company values, and the generous benefits we offer.\n</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>Our technology</b></h2>\n<p>\nOur sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.</p>\n<p>\nWe utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.</p>\n<p>\nWe embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.</p>\n<p>\nWe do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nYour experience\n</b></h2><p>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.</p>\n<p>\nMost of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nYour work at Aha!</b></h2>\n<p>\nWe work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:</p>\n<ul><li><p>\nImplementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</p></li><li><p>\nBuilding deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</p></li><li><p>\nWorking proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</p></li><li><p>\nInvestigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</p></li><li><p>\nInterfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation</p></li><li><p>\nDocumenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency</p></li></ul>\n<p>\nIf this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. (A real human reviews every application.)</p>\n<p>\n#LI-REMOTE</p><br>\n<div></div>\n<p>\nWe are building a distributed team, and you can work from anywhere in the United States, Canada, or Mexico for this role. We offer generous salary, equity, benefits, and a profit-sharing program.</p>\n<div><h4 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nDiversity</b></h4><p>\nWe are committed to hiring, promoting, and compensating employees based on their qualifications and demonstrated ability to perform job responsibilities. As an equal opportunity employer, Aha! welcomes all employees and applicants, without regard to age, race, color, national origin, physical or mental disability, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or veteran status, condition of pregnancy, or any other legally protected characteristic.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"mosaic-zone\" id=\"mosaic-zone-belowFullJobDescription\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                try {\n                    window.mosaic.onMosaicApiReady(function() {\n                        var zoneId = 'belowFullJobDescription';\n                        var providers = window.mosaic.zonedProviders[zoneId];\n\n                        if (providers) {\n                            providers.filter(function(p) { return window.mosaic.lazyFns[p]; }).forEach(function(p) {\n                                return window.mosaic.api.loadProvider(p);\n                            });\n                        }\n                    });\n                 } catch (e) {};\n                </script>",

We’re heavy DTC advertisers and our success is linked to how well our web and mobile acquisition funnels convert. So, we’ve created a standalone digital optimization SWAT team that can focus exclusively on iterating rapidly with high volume conversion rate optimization (CRO) testing. If you’re obsessed with creating the perfect user experience, love to contribute your ideas and get a thrill when your test wins, please read on.</p><p><b>Who Are We?</b></p><p>Metabolic Living is a self-funded, profitable, rapidly growing multi-channel DTC health and wellness company with 100+ on our team and on pace to hit $50MM in 2020. For the last 9 years we’ve been quietly developing our metabolic optimization products and fine-tuning our business model. Everything is now clicking, so we’re stepping on the gas as we march towards our goal of becoming a billion-dollar multi-channel brand by 2024. <b>We’ve always been 100% remote and will stay that way as we scale.</b></p><p>We’re fortunate to be thriving during these challenging COVD times as we provide exactly what everyone wants. The overall trend towards health and wellness was already a wind in our sails, but COVID lit a match and set our growth on fire, dramatically accelerating things. This is your opportunity to help us make a meaningful impact, precisely at the time when the world needs it the most.</p><p><b>What are the Key Points?</b></p><ul><li><b>Compensation</b>: $110,000 - $135,000 (plus bonus)</li><li><b>Location</b>: 100% Remote (virtual team of 100+ with no corporate office)</li><li><b>Benefits</b>: Health/Dental/Vision/Disability/Life + Robust 401k + 15 Days PTO</li><li><b>Hours</b>: 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EASTERN (regardless of where you live)</li></ul><ul><li><b>Culture</b>: Human-first with High-Performing, Happy &amp; Humble People (no jerks)</li><li><b>Personality</b>: Obsessed with Distilling the Complex into the Simple</li></ul><p><b>What’s the Big Opportunity?</b></p><p><b>Hello, my name is Kaitlin Reiss, Head of Ecommerce at Metabolic Living, and I need your help. </b>We’ve hired the leader of our digital optimization team who has 3,200 split tests under his belt (yes, really!). And now we’re recruiting the remaining pieces of this world-class team as we get ready to launch two major strategic initiatives to introduce our new brand: our state-of-the-art e-commerce website and customized metabolic optimization app that leverages machine learning and AI. We couldn’t be more excited to build this dedicated digital optimization team because it means we can move lightning fast.</p><p>If you’re as obsessed with testing as I am, this is a dream-scenario. I joined the company because I wanted to be part of building their new brand, to build something special, to build it the <i>right</i> way. But building things the right way is a constant process of optimization. And to do that we need the help of a world-class UI/UX front-end developer who can help us rapidly iterate.</p><p>That’s why this is a fantastic opportunity for someone with an inquisitive, consumer-oriented mindset who’s oozing with ideas and obsessed with creating amazing user experiences that convert like crazy. You get annoyed when pixels aren’t perfect and when UXs and UIs don’t make sense… and scratch your head when you buy something on another website or app and wonder why their checkout process is so inefficient! You love to get creative and your first instinct at a challenge is never “it can’t be done” but rather “I’ll figure it out” … and then you deliver and make it happen.</p><p>Sure, we need someone who can carve up mockups… but were looking for so much more. We want your ideas! We want to tap into your creative problem-solving brain to improve overall usability and to smartly leverage technology to make everything faster, more scalable, smoother, and easier. You’ll work with the CRO director, UX/UI designer, copywriter and other SWAT team members to develop hypotheses, propose treatments, collaboratively build tests, analyze results for key learnings and repeat.</p><p>Your days will be exciting and filled with variety. One day you might be optimizing a quiz in our performance funnels… another day you may be optimizing a checkout or upsell page our e-comm website… another day you might be optimizing the onboarding experience in our customized metabolic optimization app.</p><p><b>What’s Our Culture Like?</b></p><p>We’re serious about high-performance, <b>so our culture is built around deep work</b> to allow uninterrupted time for the intense concentration needed to deliver world-class performance. At the same time, real collaboration and transparency is critical to keep us all in alignment and keep office politics out of the equation. These aren’t just talking points – we’ve implemented specific policies, for example:</p><ul><li>A standardized 8:30 to 5:00 p.m. ET schedule to protect your <b>personal and family time</b></li><li>No meetings before 1 p.m. ET to empower you with 4 hours truly of <b>deep work to GSD</b></li><li>Daily huddles and weekly 1-on-1s to support your ability to <b>focus on what matters most</b></li></ul><p><b>Should You Apply?</b></p><p>If after reading this it’s screaming “this is for me” and…</p><ul><li>You LOVE split testing and are completely addicted to testing and learning…</li><li>You LOVE tinkering with user interfaces until they’re just right…</li><li>You LOVE writing clean, efficient code that turns Zeplin mockups into pixel-perfect executions…</li><li>You LOVE figuring out how to create fast-loading websites and apps with the best tech…</li><li>You LOVE being part of a cross-functional high-performing team that moves fast…</li></ul><p>Then please read on as you’re the ideal candidate… and we’d love to talk to you ASAP.</p><p><b>What Does Metabolic Living Do?</b></p><p>The most common question we get is – what the heck do you do? Because from the outside in, unless you’re a customer, it can be confusing, There’s a reason: We built everything organically in reverse, starting with our first nutrition program in 2012, then our first exercise program in 2014 and then launching our full ecosystem of products, including nutraceuticals, functional foods, subscriptions, memberships, 1-on-1 coaching and more. These are all marketed separately under different DTC websites and brands in a direct response (DR) manner.</p><p>And now we’re centralizing everything under our new brand, Metabolic Living, with our flagship website and app launching later this year, transitioning us from purely DR to a multi-channel traditional brand. The website at metabolicliving.com is a temporary one for COVID to raise $45k for frontline health workers. This website will be replaced with the fully branded e-commerce-driven one soon.</p><p>Normally, companies launch with a brand and then figure out how to make money. We did that in reverse – pinpointing pain points, curating world-class products, validating product-market match, generating cash flow to self-fund our growth, creating our north star (see more below), building out our operational team along the way and then retrofitting the brand on top. Strange path, but here we are. Read our full story here: https://www.linkedin.com/company/metabolic-living/about/.</p><p>We provide the full ecosystem of products and services that help you quickly optimize your metabolism so you can feel, look and perform your best, every day… yet without the yo-yo struggle of traditional approaches. Rather than a one-sized-fits-all approach like Paleo, Vegan, Keto, etc. we empower you with a flexible <i>framework</i> called our <i>Metabolic OSTM</i> that’s 100% customized to you. It allows you to get results fast and to sustain those results as your body, mind and daily life changes as you age. Without this flexible framework, those rigid approaches ultimately backfire, leaving you worse off.</p><p><b>What Key Skills and Experience are Needed?</b></p><ul><li><b>5+ years Front-End Development </b>– You’ve got complete mastery of all front-end development languages (html/css/javascript) and popular frameworks for web, mobile, and single page apps</li><li><b>3+ Years App + e-Commerce</b> – You’ve been exposed to heavy development work building and optimizing mobile apps and responsive e-commerce websites</li><li><b>2+ Years Optimization Experience</b> – You’re well versed in how to sprint inside an environment of constant A/B split testing, building hypotheses, conducting tests and evaluating results</li></ul><ul><li><b>Pixel-perfect Mindset</b> – You’ve got a very detail-oriented eye and know how to translate Zeplin mockups into pixel perfection and are bothered by anything that seems “off”</li><li><b>Obsessively Clean Coder </b>– You take pride in writing clean, readable code that’s reusable and follows best practices and you feel compelled to correct any code that’s not up to par</li><li><b>Growth-Oriented </b>– You love to constantly hone your skills via on-the-job learning opportunities, online learning courses and other challenges that keep your skills ahead of the curve</li><li><b>Driven to Excellence</b> – You’ve got an ownership mentality with an innate inner drive to excellence that other people who aren’t built that way find disturbingly intense : -)</li><li><b>Relentlessly Persists </b>– You stay focused until the task is done by embracing a get-it-done attitude and relentlessly attacking problems at different angles until they’re solved</li></ul><ul><li><b>Humble</b> – You package all of the above skills inside a humble mindset in which you listen more than talk, absorb more than dictate and are in constant “beta” mode, learning all you can</li></ul><p><b>What You'll Enjoy from Us: </b></p><ul><li><b>A Curated Team </b>– A very supportive team of other high-performers who like to get things done, hold themselves accountable and help each other out wherever possible</li><li><b>A Nurturing Culture</b> – A culture that supports and nurtures your need to learn, grow and challenge yourself to be the best you possibly can be</li><li><b>A Fantastic Lifestyle</b> – A 100% remote experience that allows you to work from home, enjoy your family, outside interests and passions</li></ul><ul><li><b>A Robust Benefits Package</b> – Full Insurance (health/dental/vison/life/disability) + Robust 401k + 15 days PTO and additional perks as we add them</li></ul><p>Job Type: Full-time</p><p>Pay: $110,000.00 - $135,000.00 per year</p><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>401(k)</li><li>401(k) matching</li><li>Dental insurance</li><li>Disability insurance</li><li>Employee discount</li><li>Flexible spending account</li><li>Health insurance</li><li>Life insurance</li><li>Paid time off</li><li>Parental leave</li><li>Vision insurance</li></ul><p>Schedule:</p><ul><li>Monday to Friday</li></ul><p>Experience:</p><ul><li>Front End Development: 5 years (Required)</li><li>E-commerce development: 3 years (Required)</li><li>Mobile applications development: 3 years (Required)</li></ul><p>Work Location:</p><ul><li>Fully Remote</li></ul><p>This Company Describes Its Culture as:</p><ul><li>Detail-oriented -- quality and precision-focused</li><li>Innovative -- innovative and risk-taking</li><li>Outcome-oriented -- results-focused with strong performance culture</li><li>Team-oriented -- cooperative and collaborative</li></ul><p>Company's website:</p><ul><li>https://www.metabolicliving.com/our-story</li></ul><p>Company's Facebook page:</p><ul><li>https://www.facebook.com/metabolicliving/</li></ul><p>Work Remotely:</p><ul><li>Yes, always</li></ul></div><div class=\"mosaic-zone\" id=\"mosaic-zone-belowFullJobDescription\"></div><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n                try {\n                    window.mosaic.onMosaicApiReady(function() {\n                        var zoneId = 'belowFullJobDescription';\n                        var providers = window.mosaic.zonedProviders[zoneId];\n\n                        if (providers) {\n                            providers.filter(function(p) { return window.mosaic.lazyFns[p]; }).forEach(function(p) {\n                                return window.mosaic.api.loadProvider(p);\n                            });\n                        }\n                    });\n                 } catch (e) {};\n                </script>",

Textio’s category-defining augmented writing platform has already transformed the way that thousands of companies write and hire, and we’re looking for a creative and driven frontend or full stack engineer to help us expand our product line.</p>\n<p>\nAs an engineer on the Application Engineering team you’ll work alongside industry-leading designers and product managers to help create ground-breaking user experiences. We are the team that builds the frontend for Textio’s user-facing applications, from everything you and our customers see on textio.com, to our Chrome browser extension and integrations, to new products currently under development. We thrive on technical challenges and building user interactions the world hasn’t seen before.</p>\n<p>\nThere is incredible opportunity to be part of the entire lifecycle of building new products: from early conception of very rough ideas, to using customer feedback to iterate and improve what you’ve built.</p>\n<p>\nIn this role you will:</p>\n<ul><li>Build human-centric UX with us using technologies like React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and CSS-in-JS. We value an ability to learn and grow together above knowing any particular technology</li>\n<li>Focus on developing user experiences, with the option to jump in and solve hard problems across the entire stack</li>\n<li>Drive technical investments from the early exploration of ideas to delivering integral parts of our stack, balancing short-term goals with long-term architectural vision</li>\n<li>Mentor others on the team to help them grow as engineers across many dimensions</li>\n<li>Lead technical initiatives or feature teams by partnering with teammates across Design, Product, Data Science, and Backend Engineering to drive complex features from start to finish</li>\n</ul><p>We’d love to hear from you if:</p>\n<ul><li>You take pride in creating powerful experiences that are simple and intuitive for users</li>\n<li>You’re naturally curious about the technologies you use and take initiative to dive in, ask questions, and figure things out</li>\n<li>You build those around you through mentoring, sharing what you know, and balancing the perspectives of everyone</li>\n<li>You thrive in an environment that tests ideas by building</li>\n<li>You have a track record of trying and learning new things</li>\n<li>You have a point of view but are low ego</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Right now, our employees are working from home. When we eventually reopen our Seattle office, we will continue to support remote work from Washington, New York, and California. Through 2021, we also support working remotely from Illinois, Colorado, Hawaii, and Oregon, but we may require physical relocation for employees in those states after 2021.</p>\n<p>\nTextio embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.
