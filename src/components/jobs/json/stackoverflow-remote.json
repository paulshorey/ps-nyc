We are an international collective&nbsp;of industry leaders, conference speakers, and subject matter experts within React, React Native and Node that are passionate about working remotely and doing good in the world.</p><br /><p>We match technically vetted engineers to pre-vetted clients. Say goodbye to hunting business, drawing up contracts, and working on dying tech. With one production focused, to the point code challenge (no whiteboarding or algorithms + on your own time) vetted by our engineering team, you'll have the opportunity to receive curated contract opportunities as well as become a part of an international collective of experts. If that sounds up your alley or you would like to find out more, please feel free to reach out to dylan@g2i.co.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>G2i is short for \"Good News to the Internet.\" We are convinced that our primary vision &amp; mission are good news to companies that need to hire engineers. While we are going about fulfilling that primary vision &amp; mission, we will also be good news to those in need. We are on a mission to help hundreds of street kids&nbsp;in Nairobi, Kenya obtain education, a safe home,&nbsp;parental care, and the love they need. We are also committed to supporting the open-source community by finding ways to financially support those who build the OSS we rely on.</p><br /><p><strong>Your background</strong></p><br /><p>In simple terms we want to hire an engineer that is excited about building applications in Node, is comfortable working in dynamic engineering environments and has strong communication and documentation skills. Here is what this actually means to us:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have 3+ years of professional development experience and have at least 1 year of Node production experience.</li><br /><li>You are willing to complete a code challenge that often takes 6-8 hours to complete (there are no due dates or timers however).</li><br /><li>You live in North America or South America.</li><br /><li>You are fluent in both verbal and written English and are comfortable communicating directly with technical and non-technical clients.</li><br /><li>You are available 30-40 hours per week.</li><br /><li>You might have full-stack experience with either Rails, React, React Native, Apollo Client/GraphQL,&nbsp;native Android (Java, Kotlin) or iOS (Objective C, Swift). But if you don't, that's OK too!</li><br /><li>You have prior experience as a freelancer or are someone that enjoys having the freedom to choose the types of projects that best align with your interests.</li><br /><li>You have prior experience working remotely or are excited about doing so.</li><br /><li>You are flexible and can adjust to the working styles of different teams. Some teams may want to pair-program and have daily interaction others may want engineers to work independently and only interact a few hours per week.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Vetting - Developers and Clients</strong></p><br /><p>We match technically vetted engineers to pre-vetted clients who place a high value on engineering and focus on running healthy projects. We take care of contracts, billing, payments and all of the other work that goes into freelancing so that engineers can focus on code and clients on building their product. Our vision is for the hiring process to be simple, trustworthy and enjoyable for both companies and engineers.</p><br /><p>When we vet clients we make sure they:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Prioritize communication</li><br /><li>Plan appropriately and have realistic timelines</li><br /><li>Understand the cost of healthy development and have a budget to pay for it</li><br /></ul><br /><p>When we vet engineers we make sure:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Engineers vet other engineers</li><br /><li>Our code challenges are to the point and based on production-level code, no whiteboarding</li><br /><li>Our process is objective, repeatable and quantitively scored</li><br /><li>Our process is completely transparent</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Who you will work with</strong></p><br /><p>We only work with companies that value engineers and run healthy engineering teams. We regularly partner with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Y Combinator</a>&nbsp;funded product companies that place a high value on engineering. Some of the companies we have worked with are: Lattice, Major League Soccer, ZeeMee, Software Engineering Daily, and Truebill with new clients coming in weekly.</p><br /><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><br /><p>G2i is an equal opportunity employer. We&rsquo;re dedicated to building a team where diversity in both ideas and identities is not only welcomed, but encouraged. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.</p><br /><p>If you'd like to learn more or set up a no-commitment exploratory call, feel free to apply here or reach out to dylan@g2i.co.

You will be the technical lead for one of these major projects.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>How will you get there?</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;d start with a short 2-week trial when you&rsquo;ll identify some things that can be improved and start improving them immediately.</p><br /><p>See, we&rsquo;re looking for someone who can teach us something &amp; take our team on the next technical level.</p><br /><p><strong>What kind of people thrive here?</strong></p><br /><p>When I&rsquo;m thinking about technical people, the ones that thrive are those that don&rsquo;t like doing the same thing twice.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>They&rsquo;re independent. They like to get to the bottom of the problem. They use the latest technologies, but they&rsquo;re realistic enough to figure out how it fits the project.</p><br /><p>Take this example: https://github.com/Codeinwp/neve/issues/1989&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Or the time an intern used a small internal hackathon as an opportunity to learn a new programming language by asking &ldquo;can the blocks be made in exotic programming languages like PureScript, F# with Fable or Elm?&rdquo;</p><br /><p>For this particular role, you&rsquo;ll need to understand WordPress really really well, have experience in leading a small team or at least running a major project on your own &amp; have strong PHP &amp; Javascript knowledge.</p><br /><p><strong>How to apply?</strong></p><br /><p>Use the form below and clearly state in a written or video form :&nbsp;</p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Your experience with WordPress development.</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>What is your favorite code performance tweak &amp; show us some code you&rsquo;ve written that you&rsquo;re proud of if possible</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Tell us a bit about yourself and why you should be considered.</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Profile links with code samples (GitHub, GitLab, WordPress.org, etc).</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Other profile links if available (Your website, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc).</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>A technical improvement that you&rsquo;ll do on https://github.com/Codeinwp/neve</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p>Please take your time to go through those and answer carefully, we don&rsquo;t have a long interview process, nor any technical tests per se, we&rsquo;ll need those answers and references to go through them and figure out your technical skills.</p><br /><p>Note: I won&rsquo;t be able to individually respond to all applications, if you&rsquo;re a match we&rsquo;ll reach out.</p><br /><p>What does the process look like?</p><br /><p>If you seem to be the right person, I will reach out to you for a quick 30&rsquo; meeting. &nbsp;I would like to learn more about what you are looking for and answer your questions, alternatively, we can do this via text as well.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>If we agree to move forward, then the next step would be a chat with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/selul\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marius</a>, our CTO, about the technical work you&rsquo;ve done and what you would like to do.</p><br /><p>If this goes well, we&rsquo;d move into the 2-week paid trial to see how things would work.</p><br /><p>If this goes well, you&rsquo;re hired.</p>",

We believe the best way to do that is by linking learning to kids&rsquo; interests, connecting them with others who share those interests, and giving them the autonomy to pick their own path. We provide small group classes that meet over live video chat where learners are connected with teachers and classmates who share their interests. These classes are offered through our marketplace and conducted on our remote learning platform. We're an experienced team with past accomplishments at Airbnb, Square, Apple, Uber, Udemy, Amazon, Google, and many startups. We came together because we wanted to make a difference in education and saw the opportunity to empower learners, teachers, and parents. Our business is growing explosively and as of August, 500,000 learners have taken more than over 2M class hours. We've already more than doubled our team since the beginning of 2020 from 25 to 70 to keep up with growth. We&rsquo;ve raised $57M since founding with most of that still in the bank. Our sales have grown 2000% in the past year to reach a run-rate of more than $100M.

    "description": "<p><strong>What is G2i?</strong></p><br /><p>G2i is a marketplace for engineers by engineers. We are a 100%, fully distributed collective of industry leaders, conference speakers, and subject matter experts within React, React Native, and Node.<br><br>G2i matches our engineers with pre-vetted clients via our marketplace. Say goodbye to hunting for clients, waiting on late payments, wading through paperwork, and working on dying tech - we handle all the boring stuff so you can work on what you love. You will&nbsp;go through our straightforward vetting process - no whiteboarding or algorithms -&nbsp;to have access to our live marketplace and become part of an international collective of React, React Native, and Node experts.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>G2i is short for \"Good News to the Internet.\" We are convinced that our primary vision &amp; mission are good news to companies that need to hire engineers. While we are going about fulfilling that primary vision &amp; mission, we will also be good news to those in need. We are on a mission to help hundreds of street kids&nbsp;in Nairobi, Kenya obtain education, a safe home,&nbsp;parental care, and the love they need. We are also committed to supporting the open-source community by finding ways to financially support those who build the OSS we rely on.</p><br /><p><strong>Your background</strong></p><br /><p>In simple terms we want to hire an engineer that is excited about building applications in React, React Native, and/or Node who is comfortable working in dynamic engineering environments and has strong communication and documentation skills. Here is what this actually means to us:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have 1+ years of professional development experience and have at least 1 year of React Native and/or React production experience.</li><br /><li>You are willing to complete a code challenge that often takes 6-8 hours to complete&nbsp;within ~7days. There is no timer on it.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You are fluent in both verbal and written English and are comfortable communicating directly with technical and non-technical clients.</li><br /><li>You are available 30-40 hours per week.</li><br /><li>You might have full-stack experience with either Rails, Node.js, Apollo Client/GraphQL,&nbsp;native Android (Java, Kotlin) or iOS (Objective C, Swift). But if you don't, that's OK too!</li><br /><li>You have prior experience as a freelancer or are someone that enjoys having the freedom to choose the types of projects that best align with your interests. You also understand that freelancing can come with potential downtime.</li><br /><li>You are flexible and can adjust to the working styles of different teams. Some teams may want to pair-program and have daily interaction others may want engineers to work independently and only interact a few hours per week.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Vetting - Developers and Clients</strong></p><br /><p>G2i also vets clients so that you'll be contracting with clients that place a high value on engineering and focus on running healthy projects. We take care of contracts, billing, payments and all of the other work that goes into freelancing so that engineers can focus on code and clients on building their product. Our vision is for the hiring process to be simple, trustworthy and enjoyable for both companies and engineers.</p><br /><p>When we vet clients we make sure they:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Prioritize communication</li><br /><li>Plan appropriately and have realistic timelines</li><br /><li>Understand the cost of healthy development and have a budget to pay for it</li><br /></ul><br /><p>When we vet engineers we make sure:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Engineers vet other engineers</li><br /><li>Our code challenges are to the point and based on production-level code, no whiteboarding</li><br /><li>Our process is objective, repeatable and quantitively scored</li><br /><li>Our process is completely transparent</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Who you will work with</strong></p><br /><p>We only work with companies that value engineers and run healthy engineering teams. We regularly partner with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Y Combinator</a>&nbsp;funded product companies that place a high value on engineering. Some of the companies we have worked with are: Lattice, Major League Soccer, ZeeMee, Software Engineering Daily, and Truebill with new clients coming in weekly.</p><br /><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><br /><p>G2i is an equal opportunity employer.

Were heavy DTC advertisers and our success is linked to how well our web and mobile acquisition funnels convert.  So, weve created a standalone digital optimization SWAT team that can focus exclusively on iterating rapidly with high volume conversion rate optimization (CRO) testing.  If youre obsessed with creating the perfect user experience, love to contribute your ideas and get a thrill when your test wins, please read on. </p><p><strong>Who Are We?</strong> </p><p>Metabolic Living is a self-funded, profitable, rapidly growing multi-channel DTC health and wellness company with 100+ on our team and on pace to hit $50MM in 2020.  For the last 9 years weve been quietly developing our metabolic optimization products and fine-tuning our business model.  Everything is now clicking, so were stepping on the gas as we march towards our goal of becoming a billion-dollar multi-channel brand by 2024.  <strong>Weve always </strong><strong>been 100% remote and will stay that way</strong><strong> as we scale.</strong> </p><p>Were fortunate to be thriving during these challenging COVD times as we provide exactly what everyone wants.  The overall trend towards health and wellness was already a wind in our sails, but COVID lit a match and set our growth on fire, dramatically accelerating things. This is your opportunity to help us make a meaningful impact, precisely at the time when the world needs it the most. </p><p><strong>What are the Key Points?</strong>  </p><ul> <li> <strong>Compensation</strong>: $110,000 - $135,000 (plus bonus) </li> <li> <strong>Location</strong>: 100% Remote (virtual team of 100+ with no corporate office)  </li> <li> <strong>Benefits</strong>: Health/Dental/Vision/Disability/Life + Robust 401k + 15 Days PTO </li> <li> <strong>Hours</strong>: 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EASTERN (regardless of where you live)  </li> </ul><ul> <li> <strong>Culture</strong>: Human-first with High-Performing, Happy &amp; Humble People (no jerks)  </li> <li> <strong>Personality</strong>: Obsessed with Distilling the Complex into the Simple </li> </ul><p> <br><strong>Whats the Big Opportunity?</strong> </p><p><strong>Hello, my name is Kaitlin Reiss, Head of Ecommerce at Metabolic Living, and I need your help.  </strong>Weve hired the leader of our digital optimization team who has 3,200 split tests under his belt (yes, really!).  And now were recruiting the remaining pieces of this world-class team as we get ready to launch two major strategic initiatives to introduce our new brand:  our state-of-the-art e-commerce website and customized metabolic optimization app that leverages machine learning and AI.  We couldnt be more excited to build this dedicated digital optimization team because it means we can move lightning fast. </p><p>If youre as obsessed with testing as I am, this is a dream-scenario.  I joined the company because I wanted to be part of building their new brand, to build something special, to build it the <em>right</em> way.  But building things the right way is a constant process of optimization. And to do that we need the help of a world-class UI/UX front-end developer who can help us rapidly iterate. </p><p>Thats why this is a fantastic opportunity for someone with an inquisitive, consumer-oriented mindset whos oozing with ideas and obsessed with creating amazing user experiences that convert like crazy.  You get annoyed when pixels arent perfect and when UXs and UIs dont make sense and scratch your head when you buy something on another website or app and wonder why their checkout process is so inefficient! You love to get creative and your first instinct at a challenge is never it cant be done but rather Ill figure it out  and then you deliver and make it happen. </p><p>Sure, we need someone who can carve up mockups but were looking for so much more.  We want your ideas!  We want to tap into your creative problem-solving brain to improve overall usability and to smartly leverage technology to make everything faster, more scalable, smoother, and easier. Youll work with the CRO director, UX/UI designer, copywriter and other SWAT team members to develop hypotheses, propose treatments, collaboratively build tests, analyze results for key learnings and repeat. </p><p>Your days will be exciting and filled with variety. One day you might be optimizing a quiz in our performance funnels another day you may be optimizing a checkout or upsell page our e-comm website another day you might be optimizing the onboarding experience in our customized metabolic optimization app. </p><p><strong>Whats Our Culture Like?</strong> </p><p>Were serious about high-performance, <strong>so our culture is built around deep work</strong> to allow uninterrupted time for the intense concentration needed to deliver world-class performance.  At the same time, real collaboration and transparency is critical to keep us all in alignment and keep office politics out of the equation.  These arent just talking points  weve implemented specific policies, for example: </p><ul> <li>A standardized 8:30 to 5:00 p.m. ET schedule to protect your <strong>personal and family time</strong> </li> <li>No meetings before 1 p.m. ET to empower you with 4 hours truly of <strong>deep work to GSD</strong> </li> <li>Daily huddles and weekly 1-on-1s to support your ability to <strong>focus on what matters most</strong> </li> </ul><p> <br><strong>Should You Apply?</strong> </p><p>If after reading this its screaming this is for me and </p><ul> <li>You LOVE split testing and are completely addicted to testing and learning </li> <li>You LOVE tinkering with user interfaces until theyre just right </li> <li>You LOVE writing clean, efficient code that turns Zeplin mockups into pixel-perfect executions </li> <li>You LOVE figuring out how to create fast-loading websites and apps with the best tech </li> <li>You LOVE being part of a cross-functional high-performing team that moves fast </li> </ul><p> <br>Then please read on as youre the ideal candidate and wed love to talk to you ASAP. </p><p><strong>What Does Metabolic Living Do?</strong> </p><p>The most common question we get is  what the heck do you do?  Because from the outside in, unless youre a customer, it can be confusing,  Theres a reason:  We built everything organically in reverse, starting with our first nutrition program in 2012, then our first exercise program in 2014 and then launching our full ecosystem of products, including nutraceuticals, functional foods, subscriptions, memberships, 1-on-1 coaching and more.  These are all marketed separately under different DTC websites and brands in a direct response (DR) manner. </p><p>And now were centralizing everything under our new brand, Metabolic Living, with our flagship website and app launching later this year, transitioning us from purely DR to a multi-channel traditional brand.  The website at metabolicliving.com is a temporary one for COVID to raise $45k for frontline health workers. This website will be replaced with the fully branded e-commerce-driven one soon. </p><p>Normally, companies launch with a brand and then figure out how to make money.  We did that in reverse  pinpointing pain points, curating world-class products, validating product-market match, generating cash flow to self-fund our growth, creating our north star (see more below), building out our operational team along the way and then retrofitting the brand on top.  Strange path, but here we are.  Read our full story here:  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/metabolic-living/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/metabolic-living/about/</a>. </p><p>We provide the full ecosystem of products and services that help you quickly optimize your metabolism so you can feel, look and perform your best, every day yet without the yo-yo struggle of traditional approaches.

It allows you to get results fast and to sustain those results as your body, mind and daily life changes as you age.

    "description": "<p><a href=\"http://artandlogic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Art+Logic</a> is looking for Full Stack Web Developers to work with us on interesting custom software projects. We&rsquo;ve been around since 1991, and we&rsquo;re still going strong.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.</p><br /><p>Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.</p><br /><p>We work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won&rsquo;t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.</p><br /><p>Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.</p><br /><p>Here&rsquo;s an example of some projects we&rsquo;ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login</li><br /><li>Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)</li><br /><li>Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What we want from you: (aka: skills)</strong></p><br /><p>We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.</p><br /><p><strong>Relationship Details:</strong></p><br /><p>We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.</p><br /><p>We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don&rsquo;t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>It&rsquo;s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren&rsquo;t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.&nbsp;</p>",

Olo benefits from the fact that over half of our workforce is remote, therefore we are accustomed to conducting interviews via video conferencing and we anticipate no impact on our recruiting timelines. We encourage candidates to share any concerns or questions with Olo&rsquo;s recruiting team.</p>",

Successful candidates will be offered a range of positions matched to their strengths. Applicants to this role will be expected to write a short submission outlining their interests, strengths and vision for the future of open source.</span></p><br /><p><strong>Exceptional Software Lead</strong></p><br /><p><span>You have proven exceptional at maths and sciences, and are looking for a technical leadership role without management responsibility.</span></p><br /><p><span>Your technology interests are diverse and may include cloud computing, IoT, or Linux itself. You have a gift for software design and implementation, and enjoy contributing to a highly professional environment with careful choices of technology, architecture, data design, and user interface. You have broad-based knowledge of Linux, networking, software development, databases, API design and possibly web presentation layers.</span></p><br /><p><span>You can demonstrate insight into performance and quality engineering practices in your field, and you have helped teams embrace effective disciplines on both fronts. You also have an understanding of security practices and principles and the impact that engineering choices have on product security.</span></p><br /><p><span>You have experience producing well-documented products and working with design professionals to shape the product. You have clearly articulated views on the ways engineering practices influence product outcomes, not just technically but in open source communities and in the marketplace.</span></p><br /><p><span>You have deep experience with either or both Python and Golang.

One of&nbsp;<em>Fast Company</em>'s prestigious Most Innovative Companies, Stardog is a fast-growing venture-backed company headquartered in Arlington, VA with a globally distributed team.</p><br /><p>Stardog Studio is the face of the Stardog Platform. It provides an IDE-like experience for Knowledge Engineers and developers to create data models, integrate data, execute and debug queries, and manage Stardog itself.</p><br /><p>But as more enterprises adopt Knowledge Graphs and Knowledge Graph-based technology, the scope of what the Studio product should provide is expanding. New personas are being introduced to the Knowledge Graph, and we are designing and building new ways for technical and non-technical users to explore, understand, design, and build their knowledge graphs.</p><br /><p>As our vision expands, so must our team. We're looking for a talented individual to be a new team lead and work alongside the technical architect of Stardog Studio and the Product Manager to help guide that part of the overall Studio product. You will be responsible for coordinating the team, conducting 1:1's, mentoring your teammates, as well as designing and building new features.</p><br /><p>Studio is written with Typescript using React, so we're expecting you to be familiar with those technologies. Bonus points if you're familiar with <a href=\"http://node.js/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Node.js</a>, Redux, and Webpack. Even more of a bonus if you know Sass, or just have some background in UX and design and are familiar with tools like Figma or Sketch.</p><br /><p>No degree? No problem. Having a piece of paper with some fancy words on it like \"Computer Science\" is great, but not a requirement. You can be an engineer without an engineering degree. What we're looking for is an experienced engineer, <em>who has guided a team before</em>, to come in, work hard, and be passionate about solving our user's problems. We are looking for real engineering work as well as demonstrable experience and skills in a leadership capacity.</p><br /><p>This is primarily a remote position. You should be comfortable with, and have experience working remotely. You must have strong communication skills as much of our interactions will be over email, chat, and PR where it's harder to get your point across. The rest of the team is in the EST (UTC-5) time zone, so the closer the time zone alignment, the better.</p><br /><p>We will expect to see code! Don't be shy about sharing your work.
