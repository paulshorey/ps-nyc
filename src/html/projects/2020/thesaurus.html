      Natural Language Processing is a branch of AI that deals with interpreting and generating text. It was fun delving
      into it. I got carried away building besta.domains, and accidentally built the most powerful English language
      thesaurus.
      <b>It's the most accurate</b> source for root-words, parts-of-speech, sentiment, and meta data like abbreviations
      and contractions. It also has pretty good synonyms, organized by sentiment - so you can choose to use only the
      most positive words - not to offend anybody and not to generate awkward phrases. &thinsp;Will soon be available as
      an API. Looking for contributors and partners to expand on its potential!
