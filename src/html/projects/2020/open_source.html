      Several simple open source tools I developed, mostly to help myself browse or develop the web. Coming soon -
      articles, ideas, and studies about the future of the web - what we can all do to better develop it, enjoy it, and
      profit from it at the same time!

      <a href="">FlySwatter.tech</a> - Free browser extension to block all the annoying popups, banners, notifications,
      widgets, and messages floating over the website content, like those "accept cookies" banners, or "sign up for our
      newsletter". They're like flies. Now you can have peace and enjoy reading online. This blocks the most intrusive
      ads too, so go ahead and turn off your ad blocker, or whitelist your favorite news sites. This only affects
      elements on the page which float on top of and block other elements. It will not hide or affect actual content on
      the page. However, you can turn it on/off per site. Works for any Chromium browser, like Firefox/Opera. Also very
      useful on mobile! Chrome mobile does not allow extensions. Try Dolphin/Opera, etc. Get it at

      <a href="">npm i colorful-console-logger</a> - Simple alternative to console.log(). Supports all console methods,
      even rare ones like time() or table(). Works on back-end and front-end! Adds color to your logs, and adds spacing
      between different groups of logs. Also, log to the cloud - integrates with LogDNA and Airbrake. If you want more
      cloud integrations, go ahead and contribute! <a href="">Github</a>

      <a href="">npm i universal-common-scripts</a> - My collection of Javascript data manipulation scripts. Easily
      sort, filter, and manipulate strings, arrays, and objects. Includes some advanced algorithmic sort functions, and
      simple ones like arr_diff or str_pad. I used it a lot on the front-end and back-end, creating my domains
      suggestions app and API. <a href="">Github</a>

      <a href="">This site</a> is actually a React.js app, but it's statically loaded like a normal website. It's able
      to handle dynamic content and interactions like an app, but it loads instantly, with real content in the
      source-code. That's good for SEO. Currently finishing integrating Gitbook as a CMS. Will use their beautiful
      editor to edit content and collaborate - then pull it in and render the content on my own site, instead of a
      separate domain. That will be very important for SEO! Tutorials and demos coming soon.
