<!--  <b class="color-dark">Notes.tech</b> - Note-taking-app as CMS.-->
<!--  <a href="https://notion.so" target="_blank">Notion.so</a> is great for writing and collaborating, but they've been-->
<!--  promising an API for years now, and developers who use it and obsess over it are getting tired of waiting. There is-->
<!--  another note taking and collaborating app which is just as good:-->
<!--  <a href="https://gitbook.com" target="_blank">GitBook.com</a>. This one also does not let you embed the content into-->
<!--  your existing site, but it does let you store all changes and files in your own GitHub repository, in markdown format!-->
<!--  You actually own your own content! Crazy idea. So, it's possible to take that and render it on your website. This will-->
<!--  be great for any company that has a "documentation" or "support / FAQ" portal. Currently you have to host it on a-->
<!--  separate domain. Soon, with my tool, you can host it on your own website. Your website SEO will greatly benefit from-->
<!--  the additional content and backlinks. Also, you'll be able to customize the look and feel of your-->
<!--  documentation/knowledgebase site.-->
