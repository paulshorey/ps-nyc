      In development... Several open source tools I'm building to help myself and others to browse and develop the web.
      Browser extension to stop all annoying popups. Better logging/debugging. Writing articles, ideas, and
      studies about the future of the web - what we can all do to utilize it more productively.
      <ul>
    <li>
      <b>FlySwatter.tech</b> - Browser extension to auto-close unwanted popups, banners, cookie notifications, intrusive ads, newsletter promotions, etc.
      Anything that is CSS position:fixed, is fixed! Does not trigger a site's ad-blocker blocker. Finally, browse in peace.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Notes.tech</b> - Note-taking-app as CMS. <a href="https://notion.so" target="_blank">Notion.so</a> is great for writing and collaborating, but they've been promising an API for years now, and developers who use
      it and obsess over it are getting tired of waiting. There is another note taking and collaborating app which is just as good: <a href="https://gitbook.com" target="_blank">GitBook.com</a>.
      This one also does not let you embed the content into your existing site, but it does let you store all changes and files in your own GitHub repository, in markdown format! You actually own your own content! Crazy idea.
      So, it's possible to take that and render it on your website. This will be great for any company that has a "documentation" or "support / FAQ" portal. Currently you have to host it on a separate domain.
      Soon, with my tool, you can host it on your own website. Your website SEO will greatly benefit from the additional content and backlinks. Also, you'll be able to customize the look and feel of your documentation/knowledgebase site.

    </li>
    <li>
      <b>npm i colorful-console-logger</b> - universal console.log replacement. Adds color, and integrates with cloud-logging like LogDNA
