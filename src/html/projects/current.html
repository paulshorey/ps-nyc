      Started out as a simple evening side project, I wanted to test my coding skills. Practicing data manipulation, I
      got carried away, and made the best thesaurus, word info, and most accurate sentiment analysis for individual
      words. My wife helped a lot with editing words and sentiment. We created the best domain suggestions (text
      generation) engine. Learn more at <a href="https://besta.domains/about" target="_blank">besta.domains/about</a>.

      A suite of text analysis APIs, including the world's most powerful, accurate, and comprehensive
      <a href="https://nlpthesaurus.com" target="_blank"> thesaurus </a>
      . Why a thesaurus? Because I set out to build a simple
      <a href="https://nlp.domains" target="_blank"> domain suggestion tool </a>
      . I soon realized that it's very difficult to generate meaningful phrases which are not awkward or offensive. It's
      also difficult to parse strings of characters with no spaces. The main goal of this venture was actually to end up
      with some sort of intellectual property. So, I started compiling my own dictionary. I figured if nothing, I could
      sell the data to some AI company. The data came out great! Demo and documentation at
