      Married to a wonderful woman, Samira. The kindest and smartest person I've ever met. As part of our wedding,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj9AAwN0XWI" target="_blank">we jumped out of an airplane</a> together,
      both for the first time. She not only fully supports my carreer and ambitions, but contributes. More about us at
      <a href="https://besta.domains" target="_blank">besta.domains/about</a>.<br />She'll be starting medical school
      next summer. We're planning to buy a house and settle down in Kansas City in Spring 2021.

        >BFA in Media Arts (interactive, digital media + design). I actually taught myself programming to pay off the
        art-school student loans. Since then, I've enjoyed doing programming, for the web and offline but using web
        technologies. It's creative and interesting. I get to make something from nothing. It's like knowing magic, or
        having a superpower!</b

      I've worked in software engineering for 12 years now, regularly taking long time off between jobs to learn new
      skills and work on personal projects. Keep saying I'll make art "next year". :) Currenly launching a couple
      micro-SaaS API products: <a href="https://besta.domains" target="_blank">besta.domains</a>/<a
        href="https://wordio.co"
        target="_blank"
        >wordio.co</a
      >. Also starting a site <a href="https://fixtheweb.dev" target="_blank">fixtheweb.dev</a> (not yet published), to
      talk about what is hurting the web right now (broken content/advertising model, annoying popups/notifications,
      broken/dead sites, greed / barriers to entry, cluttered inbox, not enough standardized syndication of content,
      outdated search results, and political confirmation bias). Will be suggesting fixes (a couple of my own projects),
      both open-source and for profit.

      Taking a break from hang-gliding and adventure sports for a couple years at least, to live in the midwest and
      focus on tech.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy Instagram: <a href="https://instagram.com/paul.shorey" target="_blank">@paul.shorey</a>. Do not use
      Facebook. Just got onto <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/paulshorey" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and
      <a href="https://twitter.com/paulshoreytech" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Need to find time to publish photos to
      500px.com.

      Will be starting a blog here very soon, about technology/javascript trends. Please check back soon. For now, I
      keep many notes in various <b>GitBook</b> and <b>Notion</b> notebooks. I recommend both of them, but especially
      Gitbook, because they let you own your own content, and store it as Markdown files, in your Github repository.
      Carving out time to build a couple open-source and SaaS solutions for our contemporary need to organize and share
      countless thoughts, notes, ideas, and documentation - personally and professionally, as individuals or team
      collaborators.

      Experimenting with social media aggregators...<br />
      I need to figure out if it's possible to manually sort arrange YouTube videos. The latest few are not the best.
      Was hoping it would be able to pull in all of them and re-shuffle. Then mix into aggregated feed. Same with
      Instagram. Business idea - build a streamlined tool to aggregate content from any source - convert website posts
      into database entries - then use this as a "headless CMS" for building websites.
