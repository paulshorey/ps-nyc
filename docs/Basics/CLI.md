#### Common Commands:  
  
**`cd`** enter directory of choice, like this for example:  
```bash  
cd ~  
cd ..  
cd /tmp  
cd Documents  
cd /Volumes/Media/Photos\ 2018  
```  
**`Ctrl C`** quit running process (to re-gain control of the CLI)  
**`fg`** resume suspended process, after accidentally doing `Ctrl X`  
<br /><br />  
  
  
  
#### Files and Folders:  
**`ls`** see contents of current directory  
**`ls -a`** see all contents, including hidden files/folders  
  
Editing files inside the terminal:  
**`vim Filename.txt`** "vim" is usually the default CLI text editor. Nice Editor is much nicer!  
**`Esc`**, then **`q!`**, then **`Enter`** exit vim without saving  
**`Esc`**, then **`wq`**, then **`Enter`** save changes, and exit  
  
Alternately, in Nice Editor:  
**`ne Filename.txt`**  
**`^s ^q`** save changes, and exit  
**`^q`**, then **`y`** to exit without saving changes (y was to confirm prompt)
