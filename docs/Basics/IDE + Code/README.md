# Try WebStorm  
  
### Lately, I've had trouble with both Sublime Text and Vs Code.  
  
**VsCode** just does not format JSX correctly, no matter what options I set. Best case scenario - it sometimes ignores JSX indentation and sometimes indents incorrectly, that's with the correct plugin and settings, explained in ./auto-formatting.md.  
In **Sublime Text**, I could not enable "format on save" no matter what I did. Instructions listed here in ./auto-formatting.md worked for others on the web.  
  
I do not like Prettier (the "opinionated" formatter), though I will use it if my team mates want to. Its formatting preferences are not as configurable as **js-beautify**, and force me to do a lot of scrolling.  
  
So, this remains an unsolved problem. Maybe I should try Emacs. I've spent enough time on this already.  
  
  
### WebStorm simply works. No problems.  
It indents JSX correctly, and has program settings which all actually do what they're supposed to when you change them. WebStorm is a good little robot that does as you command it.  
  
  
### Other benefits...  
  
It has several more sophisticated features - ones you would have to spend a long time finding and configuring just right in open source editors.  
  
* When you re-name a file or folder, it can search all the source code in the project, and rename any references to that file, to prevent broken links.  
  
* Key mapping has a very easy interface! Feel free to remap all your favorite shortcuts, including Macros.  
  
  
### Unfortunately,  
  
* It costs money!  
* Color themes are lacking in variety, and are difficult to customize.
