# How To:           
### Edit remote files over SSH connection           
...not in the terminal, but using your favorite local IDE!           
<br /><br />           
           
#### On server,           
Install rsub:           
```           
wget -O /usr/local/bin/rsub \https://raw.github.com/aurora/rmate/master/rmate           
chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/rsub           
```           
#### On local,           
For _SublimeText3_, or _Textmate_, install **`rsub`** package.           
Or on _VsCode_, install **`remote-vscode`** package.           
Add proxy:           
```           
echo "RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698" >> ~/.ssh/config           
```           
#### Now you can connect to the server and edit any file:           
```           
ssh user@hostname           
rsub ~/.profile           
```           
<br /><br />           
           
## Emacs text editor           
in addition to simply editing the file, it can act as the connection agent, and the remote filebrowser too ~~ so you can connect, browse, open, and edit files all in Emacs!
