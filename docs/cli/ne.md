# EDITOR=ne  
A "nice editor" for command line and GIT commits. By far the most intuitive CLI editor to use, supports some basic features and bindings. `Ctr S` to save. `Ctr Q` to quit. `Esc Esc` for dropdown UI, right in the terminal.  
  
#### Make Default:  
```  
echo "export EDITOR=ne" >> ~/.zprofile  
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts:  
(including the custom ~/.ne/.keys configuration below)  
  
> **^s**, **^q** - save, quit  
> **^z**, **^x**, **^c**, **^v**  - undo, cut, copy, paste  
> **^y**  - delete current line  
> **^u**  - paste deleted line  
>  
> **^d** - delete line  
> **^w**, **^e** - start of, end of line  
  
## Custom Key Bindings:  
hit: **`^k`**  
type: **`kc`**  
hit **`key`** to see its hex code and currently bound command  
**`echo 'KEY {CODE} {ACTION}' >> ~/.ne/.keys`**  
  
> `fn` key code is a prefix `0x`, plus the normal key code.  
> So, `delete` key code is `115`. But, `fn + delete` key code is `0x115`.
