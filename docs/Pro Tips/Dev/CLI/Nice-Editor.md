# EDITOR=ne  
A "nice" editor. By far the most intuitive CLI editor to use, supports some basic features and bindings. `Ctr S` to save. `Ctr Q` to quit. `Esc Esc` for an actual dropdown UI, right in the terminal. It's magic!  
  
#### Make Default:  
```  
echo "export EDITOR=ne" >> ~/.profile  # if you use the standard Mac terminal  
echo "export EDITOR=ne" >> ~/.zprofile  # if you use Zsh  
echo "[core]\n\teditor = ne" >> ~/.gitconfig  # to use it for git messages  
```  
Restart the terminal, then you'll be able to do:  
```  
ne myFile.txt # to edit stuff  
git commit # to commit, as usual, but without having to use Vim  
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts:  
(when using the custom ~/.ne/.keys configuration below)  
  
> **^s**, **^q** - save, quit  
> **^z**, **^r**  - undo, redo  
> **^x**, **^c**, **^v**  - cut, copy, paste  
> **^y**  - delete current line  
> **^u**  - paste deleted line  
>  
> **^d** - delete line  
> **^w**, **^e** - start of, end of line  
  
## Custom Key Bindings:  
1. hit: **`^k`**  
2. type: **`kc`**  
3. hit **`key`** to see its hex code and currently bound command  
4. **`echo 'KEY {CODE} {ACTION}' >> ~/.ne/.keys`**  
  
> **`fn + a`**  
> To convert any key (`delete`) to fn-key (`fn + delete`), just add a prefix `0x` before the key code.  
> Key code for `delete` is `115`. So, key code for `fn + delete` would be `0x115`.
