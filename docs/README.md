# Paul's (front-end-focused) Web Development Knowledgebase  
A repository of useful tips, tricks, shortcuts, and general knowledge about web application development<br />  
because sometimes we forget.  
<br /><br />  
  
**This is an exciting journey** to find a decent solution for documenting small to medium size web projects. So far, it's a great success! Very easy to edit and collaborate (markdown files), and very easy to convert to a website (`npm run docs`, which actually runs `markdown-folder-to-html docs www/paulshorey/docs`).  
  
**This website was auto-generated** from [my repository](http://github.com/paulshorey/ps) `./docs` folder, using [joakin/markdown-folder-to-html](https://github.com/joakin/markdown-folder-to-html). Actually, it's currently using my own experimental version [paulshorey/markdown-folder-to-html](https://github.com/paulshorey/markdown-folder-to-html). After it's stable, I will submit an issue and pull-request to Joaquin.  
  
**If anyone wants to contribute** to this knowledgebase, and share ownership, please contact me! I'll be happy to move this to its own repository.

# This is a work in progress  
  
**Unfortunate issues:**  
* Folders and files are stored and displayed in alphabetical order.  
* File names can have spaces, but a space in the filename prevents you from linking to the file from other markdown files (this is a markdown issue).  
  
  
**Todo:**  
* Fix mobile CSS  
* Add functionality, when compiling .html files, to modify the original .md file... to add double space at the end of every line which does not already have them. (for Github flavor compatibility)
