# IDE for Javascript Projects  
  
After agreeing on and sticking to **tabs** or 2 spaces or 4 spaces, most important thing to is:  
  
Make sure your **and your teammates'** text-editor or IDE do not change your code unexpectedly.  
  
### If using VS CODE:  
* Install the **`js beautify`** plugin  
* Add **`.jsbeautifyrc`** file to the root of your project, to specify formatting rules.  
* By default, it formats every file on save! To turn this off, toggle **`files.autoSave`** in Vs Code preferences.  
  
### If using Sublime Text:  
* Install `htmlprettify` plulgin: https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-HTMLPrettify  
* Use the same **`.jsbeautifyrc`** file as your teammates use for Vs Code.  
* Sublime does not format on save by default. Toggle **`format_on_save`** in HTMLPrettify plugin options.  
  
### If using something else:  
* Just make sure whatever settings you use matches your teammates' settings.  
  
### Quick (one-off experiments) and Dirty (code):  
* This is a great online code beautifier: <br />https://www.10bestdesign.com/dirtymarkup/  
* Unlike others, this one actually maintains HTML tags hierarchy and indentation
