### Units and Responsive design:      
      
#### With only a little work, your pixel sizes can scale proportionally with the viewer's screen size.      
But that's not all. Keep reading, and this applies also to ALL CSS properties, not just font-size. Also margin, padding, top, left, border, width, height, etc. They can all be responsive just by adding some dynamic text sizes.      
      
```css      
/* set your default text size for the page */      
html {      
    font-size: 16.5px;      
}      
/* make smaller for smaller screens */      
@media (max-width: 950px),(max-height: 750px) {      
    html {      
        font-size: 15px;      
    }      
}      
@media (max-width: 750px),(max-height: 650px) {      
    html {      
        font-size: 12.5px;      
    }      
}      
@media (max-width: 380px),(max-height: 380px) {      
    html {      
        font-size: 11.5px;      
    }      
}      
@media (max-width: 330px),(max-height: 330px) {      
    html {      
        font-size: 10.5px;      
    }      
}      
/* make bigger for extra large screens */      
@media (min-width: 1600px) {      
    html {      
        font-size: 19px;      
    }      
}      
```      
      
#### That's it. You're done. Now you can use responsive **`rem`** units instead of static pixels.      
      
Now, you can style an `<h1>` tag to have `font-size` of `2rem` pixels instead of `30px`. The difference is:      
1. Traditionally, with static pixels, no matter what screen size, your text would be always 30px. On a big screen, it may be too small. On a phone screen, it would be too big.      
2. Responsive size of `2rem` means that whatever you are sizing is 2 times the font-size of the `<html>` element. If the `<html>`  font size is "16.5px", then "2rem" equates to "33px". On a small screen, where the `<html>` font size is "11.5px", then "2rem" means only "23px".      
      
> `3rem` is 3 times the `<html>` font size.      
> `1.5rem` is 1.5 times.      
> You can even do small amounts like `0.01rem`, instead of `1px` - useful for borders or padding.      
      
      
With no extra effort. Apply the same sizing to your padding, and widths, especially "max-width", to have larger UI distances on larger screens, and small compact styling for phones and tablets.
