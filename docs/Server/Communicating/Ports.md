**Servers usually serve incoming visitor web traffic on port 80. So, http://google.com is the same as http://google.com:80**      
<br />      
      
**However**, on your local Macbook, ports below **1000** are blocked. So, running a Node webserver on port **80** will not work. The browser url will try to go to port 80, but that request will not find its way to your system process.      
<br />      
      
**That's ok, we can run our Node.js script on port 1080 instead.**      
<br />      
      
But if we want to run the server at just `http://localhost`, not `http://localhost:80`, then we have to redirect all incoming requests from port 80 to port 1080:      
      
```      
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1080      
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1443      
ufw allow 80/tcp      
ufw allow 443/tcp      
```
